A and B, \\nintending  to  cause  Z\\'s  death,  knowingly  co-operate  in  causing  that  effect  by  illegally  omitting,  each  during  the  time  of  his \\nattendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose.

A,  intending  to  cause  Z\\'s  death,  illegally  omits  to  supply  Z  with  food;  in \\nconsequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from his \\noffice, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or co-operation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is \\nlikely thereby to cause Z\\'s death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not co-operate with B. A is guilty only of \\nan attempt to commit murder. \\n\\n38. Persons concerned in criminal act may be guilty of different offences.—Where several persons \\nare engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different offences by \\nmeans of that act. \\n\\nA  attacks  Z  under  such  circumstances  of  grave  provocation  that  his  killing  of  Z  would  be  only  culpable  homicide  not \\namounting to murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and intending to kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, assists \\nA in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged in causing Z\\'s death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable \\nhomicide. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\n19 \\n\\n                                                           \\n1.

Here, A may not have intended to cause death; and may even be sorry that death has been caused by his act; yet, if he \\nknew that he was likely to cause death, he has caused death voluntarily. \\n\\n40. “Offence”.—Except in the Chapters and sections mentioned in clauses 2 and 3 of this section, \\n\\nthe word “offence” denotes a thing made punishable by this Code. \\n\\nIn Chapter IV, Chapter VA and in the following sections, namely, sections 64, 65, 66, 67, 71], \\n109, 110, 112, 114, 115, 116, 117,118, 119 and 120 187, 194, 195, 203, 211, 213, 214, 221, 222, 223, \\n224,225,  327,  328,  329,  330,  331,  347,  348,  388,  389  and  445,  the  word  “offence”  denotes  a  thing \\npunishable under this Code, or under any special or local law as hereinafter defined. \\n\\nAnd in sections 141, 176, 177, 201, 202, 212, 216 and 441, the word “offence” has the same meaning \\nwhen the thing punishable under the special or local law is punishable under such law with imprisonment \\nfor a term of six months or upwards, whether with or without fine.]  \\n\\n41. “Special law”.—A “special law” is a law applicable to a particular subject. \\n\\n42. “Local law”.—A “local law” is a law applicable only to a particular part of India]. \\n\\n43. “Illegal”. “Legally bound to do”.—The word  “illegal” is applicable to everything which is an \\noffence or which is prohibited by law, or which furnishes ground for a civil action; and a person is said to \\nbe “legally bound to do” whatever it is illegal in him to omit. \\n\\n44. “Injury”.—The word “injury” denotes any harm whatever illegally caused to any person, in body, \\n\\nmind, reputation or property. \\n\\n45. “Life”.—The word “life” denotes the life of a human being, unless the contrary appears from the \\n\\n46. “Death”.—The word “death” denotes the death of a human being unless the contrary appears from \\n\\ncontext. \\n\\nthe context. \\n\\n47. “Animal”.—The word “animal” denotes any living creature, other than a human being. \\n\\n48.  “Vessel”.—The  word  “vessel”  denotes  anything  made  for  the  conveyance  by  water  of  human \\n\\nbeings or of property. \\n\\n49. “Year”. “Month”.—Wherever the word “year” or the word “month” is used, it is to be understood \\n\\nthat the year or the month is to be reckoned according to the British calendar. \\n\\n50. “Section”.—The word “section” denotes one of those portions of a Chapter of this Code which are \\n\\ndistinguished by prefixed numeral figures. \\n\\n51. “Oath”.—The word “oath” includes a solemn affirmation substituted by law for an oath, and any \\ndeclaration required or authorised by law to be made before a public servant or to be used for the purpose \\nof proof, whether in a Court of Justice or not. \\n\\n52. “Good faith”.—Nothing is said to be done or believed in “good faith” which is done or believed \\n\\nwithout due care and attention. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1.

Here, if seventy-five \\nrupees of the fine be paid or levied before the expiration of one month of the imprisonment, A will be discharged as soon as the \\nfirst month has expired. If seventy-five rupees be paid or levied at the time of the expiration of the first month, or at any later time \\nwhile  A  continues  in  imprisonment,  A  will  be  immediately  discharged.  If  fifty  rupees  of  the  fine  be  paid or  levied  before  the \\nexpiration of two months of the imprisonment. A will be discharged as soon as the two months are completed.

Limit  of  punishment  of  offence  made  up  of  several  offences.—Where  anything  which  is  an \\noffence is made up of parts, any of which parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished with \\nthe punishment of more than one of such his offences, unless it be so expressly provided. \\n\\nWhere anything is an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law in force for \\n\\nthe time being by which offences are defined or punished, or \\n\\nwhere several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves constitute an offence, \\n\\nconstitute, when combined, a different offence, \\n\\nthe offender shall not be punished with a more severe punishment than the Court which tries him could \\n\\naward for any one of such offences. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A gives Z fifty strokes with a stick. Here A may have committed the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to Z by the whole \\nbeating, and also by each of the blows which make up the whole beating. If A were liable to punishment for every blow, he might \\nbe imprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow. But he is liable only to one punishment for the whole beating. \\n\\n(b) But, if, while A is beating Z, Y interferes, and A intentionally strikes Y, here, as the blow given to Y is no part of the act \\nwhereby A voluntarily causes hurt to Z, A is liable to one punishment for voluntarily causing hurt to Z, and to another for the blow \\ngiven to Y. \\n\\n72. Punishment of person guilty of one of several offences, the judgment stating that it is doubtful \\nof  which.—In  all  cases  in  which  judgment  is  given  that  a  person  is  guilty  of  one  of  several  offences \\nspecified in the judgment, but that it is doubtful of which of these offences he is guilty, the offender shall \\nbe punished for the offence for which the lowest punishment is provided if the same punishment is not \\nprovided for all. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Ins. by Act 8 of 1882, s. 3. \\n2. Added by s. 4, ibid. \\n\\n \\n\\n23 \\n\\n\\x0c73. Solitary confinement.—Whenever any person is convicted of an offence for which under this Code \\nthe Court has power to sentence him to rigorous imprisonment, the Court may, by its sentence, order that \\nthe offender shall be kept in solitary confinement for any portion or portions of the imprisonment to which \\nhe is sentenced, not exceeding three months in the whole, according to the following scale, that is to say— \\n\\na time not exceeding one month if the term of imprisonment shall not exceed six months; \\n\\na time not exceeding two months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed six months andshall not \\n\\nexceed one year \\n\\na time not exceeding three months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed one year. \\n\\n74.  Limit  of  solitary  confinement.—In  executing  a  sentence  of  solitary  confinement,  such \\nconfinement shall in no case exceed fourteen days at a time, with intervals between the periods of solitary \\nconfinement of not less duration than such periods; and when the imprisonment awarded shall exceed three \\nmonths, the solitary confinement shall not exceed seven days in any one month of the whole imprisonment \\nawarded, with intervals between the periods of solitary confinement of not less duration than such periods. \\n\\n75.  Enhanced  punishment  for  certain  offences  under  Chapter  XII  or  Chapter  XVII  after \\n\\nprevious conviction.—Whoever, having been convicted,— \\n\\n(a) by a Court in India, of an offence punishable under Chapter XII or Chapter XVII of this Code \\n\\nwith imprisonment of either description for a term of three years or upwards, shall be guilty of any offence punishable under either of those Chapters with like imprisonment for the like \\nterm, shall be subject for every such subsequent offence to imprisonment for life, or to imprisonment of \\neither description for a term which may extend to ten years.] \\n\\nCHAPTER IV \\n\\nGENERAL EXCEPTIONS \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n76. Act done by a person bound, or by mistake of fact believing himself bound, by law.—Nothing \\nis an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of \\na mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be, bound by law to do it. \\n\\n(a)  A,  a  soldier,  fires  on  a  mob by  the  order  of  his  superior  officer,  in  conformity  with  the  commands  of  the  law.  A  has \\n\\ncommitted no offence. \\n\\narrests Z. A has committed no offence. \\n\\n(b) A, an officer of a Court of Justice, being ordered by that Court to arrest Y, and after due enquiry, believing Z to be Y, \\n\\n77.  Act  of  Judge when  acting judicially.—Nothing  is  an offence  which  is  done  by  a  Judge  when \\nacting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which in good faith he believes to be, given to \\nhim by law. \\n\\n78. Act done pursuant to the judgment or order of Court.—Nothing which is done in pursuance of, \\nor which is warranted by the judgment or order of, a Court of Justice; if done whilst such judgment or order \\nremains  in  force,  is  an  offence,  notwithstanding  the  Court  may  have  had  no  jurisdiction  to  pass  such \\njudgment  or  order,  provided  the  person  doing  the  act  in  good  faith  believes  that  the  Court  had  such \\njurisdiction. \\n\\n79. Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself, justified, by law.—\\nNothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Subs. by Act 8 of 1862, s. 5, for “be less than a”. \\n2. Subs. by Act 3 of 1910, s. 2, for section 75. \\n3. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A. O. 1948, the A. O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch., \\n\\nto read as above. \\n\\n4. The word “or” omitted by Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch. \\n5. Cl. (b) omitted by s. 3 and the Sch., ibid. \\n6. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). \\n\\n \\n\\n24 \\n\\n\\x0cof fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith, believes himself to be justified by law, in doing \\nit. \\n\\nA sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, of the \\npower which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in the fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper \\nauthorities. A has committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in self-defence. \\n\\n80. Accident in doing a lawful act.—Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, \\nand without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful \\nmeans and with proper care and caution. \\n\\nA is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here, if there was no want of proper caution \\n\\non the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence. \\n\\n81.  Act  likely  to  cause  harm,  but  done without  criminal intent,  and  to  prevent  other  harm.—\\nNothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause harm, \\nif it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of preventing \\nor avoiding other harm to person or property. \\n\\nExplanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was \\nof such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that it \\nwas likely to cause harm. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly, and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a position \\nthat, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless  he \\nchanges the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with only two \\npassengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in \\ngood faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run \\ndown the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger \\nwhich he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C. \\n\\n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention \\nin good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so \\nimminent as to excuse A\\'s act, A is not guilty of the offence. \\n\\n82. Act of a child under seven years of age.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under \\n\\nseven years of age.  \\n\\n83.  Act  of  a  child  above  seven  and  under  twelve  of  immature  understanding.—Nothing  is  an \\noffence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under twelve, who has not attained sufficient \\nmaturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion. \\n\\n84. Act of a person of unsound mind.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the \\ntime of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he \\nis doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. \\n\\n85. Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will.—\\nNothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, \\nincapable  of  knowing  the  nature  of  the  act,  or  that  he  is  doing  what  is  either  wrong,  or  contrary  to  \\nlaw;  provided  that  the  thing  which  intoxicated  him  was  administered  to  him  without  his  knowledge  or \\nagainst his will. \\n\\n86. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.—In \\ncases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person who \\ndoes the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge as he \\nwould have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was administered to \\nhim without his knowledge or against his will. \\n\\n87.  Act  not  intended  and  not  known  to  be  likely  to  cause  death  or  grievous  hurt,  done  by \\nconsent.—Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the \\ndoer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, \\nor be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has given consent, \\n\\n \\n\\n25 \\n\\n\\x0cwhether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the \\ndoer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm. \\n\\nA and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which, \\n\\nin the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence. \\n\\n88. Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person\\'s benefit.—Nothing, \\nwhich is not intented to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended \\nby the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is \\ndone in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm, or to take \\nthe risk of that harm. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who suffers under the painful complaint, \\nbut not intending to cause Z\\'s death, and intending, in good faith, Z\\'s benefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z\\'s consent. A has \\ncommitted no offence. \\n\\n89. Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, by or by consent of guardian.—\\nNothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or of unsound \\nmind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of \\nthat person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause or \\nbe known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: Provided— \\n\\nProvisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or to the \\n\\nattempting to cause death; \\n\\nSecondly.—That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing it \\nknows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, \\nor the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\n\\nThirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the \\nattempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or \\nthe curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\n\\nFourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing \\n\\nof which offence it would not extend. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, in good faith, for his child\\'s benefit without his child\\'s consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon knowing it to \\nbe likely that the operation will cause the child\\'s death, but not intending to cause the child\\'s death. A is within the exception,  \\ninasmuch as his object was the cure of the child. \\n\\n90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.—A consent is not such a consent as is \\nintended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a \\nmisconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent was \\ngiven in consequence of such fear or misconception; or \\n\\nConsent of insane person.—if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or \\n\\nintoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or \\n\\nConsent of child.—unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person \\n\\nwho is under twelve years of age. \\n\\n91. Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm cause.—The exceptions in sections \\n87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they may cause, \\nor be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or on whose \\nbehalf the consent is given. \\n\\nCausing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is offence independently of \\nany harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”; and \\nthe consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\n26 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c92. Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.—Nothing is an offence by reason \\nof any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without that \\nperson\\'s consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, or if \\nthat person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of him from \\nwhom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided— \\n\\nProvisos.  First.—That  this  exception  shall  not  extend  to  the  intentional  causing  of  death,  or  the \\n\\nattempting to cause death; \\n\\nSecondly.—That this exception shall not extend  to the doing of anything which the person doing it \\nknows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or \\nthe curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\n\\nThirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to \\n\\ncause hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt; \\n\\nFourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing of \\n\\nwhich offence it would not extend. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be trepanned. A, not intending Z\\'s death, \\nbut in good faith, for Z\\'s benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed no \\noffence. \\n\\n(b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill Z, but not intending to kill Z, \\n\\nand in good faith intending Z\\'s benefit. A\\'s ball gives Z a mortal wound. A has committed no offence. \\n\\n(c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an operation be immediately performed. \\nThere is not time to apply to the child\\'s guardian. A performs the operation in spite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in good \\nfaith, the child\\'s benefit. A has committed no offence. \\n\\n(d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A drops the child from the house stop, \\nknowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child\\'s \\nbenefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence. \\n\\nExplanation.—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 88, 89 and 92. \\n\\n93. Communication made in good faith.—No communication made in good faith is an offence by \\n\\nreason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live. The patient dies in consequence of the \\n\\nshock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient\\'s death. \\n\\n94. Act to which a person is compelled by threats.—Except murder, and offences against the State \\npunishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, \\nwhich,  at  the  time  of  doing  it,  reasonably  cause  the  apprehension  that  instant  death  to  that  person  will \\notherwise  be  the  consequence:  Provided  the  person  doing  the  act  did  not  of  his  own  accord,  or  from  a \\nreasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which \\nhe became subject to such constraint. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins a gang \\nof dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the ground of his \\nhaving been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant death, to do a \\nthing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of \\na house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception. \\n\\n95. Act causing slight harm.—Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to \\ncause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of ordinary \\nsense and temper would complain of such harm. \\n\\n96. Things done in private defence.—Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right \\n\\n \\nOf the Right of Private Defence \\n\\n27 \\n\\nof private defence. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c97. Right of private defence of the body and of property.—Every person has a right, subject to the \\n\\nrestrictions contained in section 99, to defend— \\n\\nFirst.—His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human body; \\n\\nSecondly.—The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against \\nany act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or \\nwhich is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass. \\n\\n98. Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc.—When an act, which \\nwould otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of maturity of \\nunderstanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by reason of any \\nmisconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence against that act \\nwhich he would have if the act were that offence. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. But A has the same right of private defence \\n\\nwhich he would have if Z were sane. \\n\\n(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A. \\nHere Z, by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z, which \\nhe would have if Z were not acting under that misconception. \\n\\n99. Acts against which there is no right of private defence.—There is no right of private defence \\nagainst an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or \\nattempted to be done, by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that act, \\nmay not be strictly justifiable by law. \\n\\nThere is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension \\nof death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant acting in \\ngood faith under colour of his office, though that direction may not be strictly justifiable by law. \\n\\nThere is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to protection of the \\n\\npublic authorities. \\n\\nExtent to which the right may be exercised.—The right of private defence in no case extends to the \\n\\ninflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence. \\n\\nExplanation  1.—A  person  is  not  deprived  of  the  right  of  private  defence  against  an  act  done,  or \\nattempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows or has reason to believe, that the person \\ndoing the act is such public servant. \\n\\nExplanation  2.—A  person  is  not  deprived  of  the  right  of  private  defence  against  an  act  done,  or \\nattempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that \\nthe person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such person states the authority under which \\nhe acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded. \\n\\n100. When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death.—The right of private \\ndefence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section, to the voluntary \\ncausing of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the offence which occasions the exercise of the \\nright be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:— \\n\\nFirst.—Such  an  assault  as  may  reasonably  cause  the  apprehension  that  death  will  otherwise  be  the \\n\\nconsequence of such assault; \\n\\nbe the consequence of such assault; \\n\\nSecondly.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise \\n\\nThirdly.—An assault with the intention of committing rape; \\n\\nFourthly.—An assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust; \\n\\nFifthly.—An assault with the intention of kidnapping or abducting; \\n\\nSixthly.—An assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under circumstances which \\nmay reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the public authorities for \\nhis release. \\n\\n \\n\\n28 \\n\\n\\x0cSeventhly.—An act of throwing or administering acid or an attempt to throw or administer acid which \\nmay reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such act. \\n\\n101. When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.—If the offence be not of any \\nof the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, the right of private defence of the body does \\nnot  extend  to  the  voluntary  causing  of  death  to  the  assailant,  but  does  extend,  under  the  restrictions \\nmentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death. \\n\\n102. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body.—The right of \\nprivate defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises \\nfrom an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed; and it \\ncontinues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues. \\n\\n103. When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death.—The right of private \\ndefence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the  voluntary causing of \\ndeath or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to \\ncommit  which,  occasions  the  exercise  of  the  right,  be  an  offence  of  any  of  the  descriptions  hereinafter \\nenumerated, namely:— \\n\\nFirst.—Robbery; \\n\\nSecondly.—House-breaking by night; \\n\\nThirdly.—Mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is \\n\\nused as a human dwelling, or as a place for the custody of property; \\n\\nFourthly.—Theft,  mischief,  or  house-trespass,  under  such  circumstances  as  may  reasonably  cause \\napprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of private defence is not \\nexercised. \\n\\nSTATE AMENDMENTS \\n\\nKarnataka \\n\\n(1) In section 103, in clause Thirdly, — \\n\\n(i) after the words “mischief by fire”, the words “or any explosive substance” Shall be inserted; \\n\\n(ii) after the words “as a human dwelling, or”the words “as a place of worship, or” shall be inserted. \\n\\n(2) After clause Fourthly, the following clause shall be inserted namely:— \\n\\n“Fifthly.— Mischief by fire or any explosive substance committed on any property used or intended to \\nbe  used  for  the  purpose  of  Government  or  any  local  authority,  statutory  body  or  company  owned  or \\ncontrolled by Government or railway or any vehicle used or adapted to be used for the carriage of passengers \\nfor hire or reward”. \\n\\n[Vide Karnataka Act 8 of 1972, sec. 2]. \\n\\n104.  When  such  right  extends  to  causing  any  harm  other  than  death.—If  the  offence,  the \\ncommitting  of  which,  or  the  attempting  to  commit  which  occasions  the  exercise  of  the  right  of  private \\ndefence,  be  theft,  mischief,  or  criminal  trespass,  not  of  any  of  the  descriptions  enumerated  in  the  last \\npreceding section, that right does not extend to the voluntary causing of death, but does extend, subject to \\nthe restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the wrong-doer of any harm other than \\ndeath. \\n\\n105. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of property.—The right of \\nprivate  defence  of  property  commences  when  a  reasonable  apprehension  of  danger  to  the  property \\ncommences. \\n\\nThe right of private defence of property against theft continues till the offender has effected his retreat \\nwith  the  property  or  either  the  assistance  of the public  authorities is  obtained,  or  the property  has  been \\nrecovered. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Ins. by Act 13 of 2013, s. 2 (w.e.f. 3-2-2013). \\n\\n29 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cThe right of private defence of property against robbery continues as long as the offender causes or \\nattempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or as long as the fear of instant death or \\nof instant hurt or of instant personal restraint continues. \\n\\nThe right of private defence of property against criminal trespass or mischief continues as long as the \\n\\noffender continues in the commission of criminal trespass or mischief. \\n\\nThe right of private defence of property against house-breaking by night continues as long as the house-\\n\\ntrespass which has been begun by such house-breaking continues. \\n\\n106.  Right  of  private  defence  against  deadly  assault  when  there  is  risk  of  harm  to  innocent \\nperson.—If in the exercise of the right of private defence against an assault which reasonably causes the \\napprehension of death, the defender be so situated that he cannot effectually exercise that right without risk \\nof harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of that risk. \\n\\nA is attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his right of private defence without firing \\non the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children who are mingled with the mob. A commits no offence if by \\nso firing he harms any of the children. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nCHAPTER V \\n\\nOF ABETMENT \\n\\n107. Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the doing of a thing, who— \\n\\nFirst.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or \\n\\nSecondly.—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that \\nthing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of \\nthat thing; or \\n\\nThirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material \\nfact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing \\nto be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z, B, knowing that fact and also that C is \\nnot Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the \\napprehension of C. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in \\norder to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid \\nthe doing of that act. \\n\\n108.  Abettor.—A  person  abets  an  offence,  who  abets  either  the  commission  of  an  offence,  or  the \\ncommission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing \\nan offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence although the \\n\\nabettor may not himself be bound to do that act. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should be \\n\\ncommitted, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of instigating \\n\\nB to commit murder. \\n\\nExplanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an \\noffence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty \\nintention or knowledge. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n30 \\n\\n\\x0cIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person \\ncapable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is \\nguilty of abetting an offence. \\n\\n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z\\'s death. \\nB, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z\\'s death. Here, though B was not capable \\nby law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an \\noffence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. \\n\\n(c)  A  instigates  B  to  set  fire  to  a  dwelling-house.  B,  in  consequence  of  the  unsoundness  of  his  mind,  being  incapable  of \\nknowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A\\'s \\ninstigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to \\nthe punishment provided for that offence. \\n\\n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession. A induces \\nB to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z\\'s possession, in good faith, believing it to be A\\'s property. \\nB, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, \\nand is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. \\n\\nExplanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also \\n\\nan offence. \\n\\nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence \\nof B\\'s instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the \\noffence, A is also liable to the same punishment. \\n\\nExplanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that \\nthe abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the \\nconspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. \\n\\nA  concerts  with  B  a  plan  for  poisoning  Z.  It  is  agreed  that  A  shall  administer  the  poison.  B  then  explains  the  plan  to  C \\nmentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A\\'s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and \\nprocures  and  delivers  it  to  B  for  the  purpose  of  its  being  used  in  the  manner  explained.  A  administers  the  poison;  Z  dies  in \\nconsequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which \\nZ has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder. \\n\\n108A. Abetment in India of offences outside India.—A person abets an offence within the meaning \\nof this Code who, in India, abets the commission of any act without and beyond  India which would \\nconstitute an offence if committed in India. \\n\\nA, in India, instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa, A is guilty of abetting murder.] \\n\\n109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express \\nprovision is made for its punishment.—Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed \\nin consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such \\nabetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. \\n\\nExplanation.—An  act  or  offence  is  said  to  be  committed  in  consequence  of  abetment,  when  it  is \\ncommitted  in  consequence  of  the  instigation,  or  in  pursuance  of  the  conspiracy,  or  with  the  aid  which \\nconstitutes the abetment. \\n\\n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the exercise of B\\'s official functions. B \\n\\naccepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined in section 161. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Added by Act 4 of 1898, s. 3. \\n2. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A.O. 1948, the A.O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch., to \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n31 \\n\\nread as above. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting \\n\\nthat offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B. \\n\\n(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he \\nmay administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A’s absence and thereby causes Z’s death. \\nHere B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder. \\n\\n110.  Punishment  of  abetment  if  person  abetted  does  act  with  different  intention  from  that  of \\nabettor.—Whoever  abets the  commission of  an  offence  shall,  if the  person  abetted  does  the  act  with  a \\ndifferent intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for the \\noffence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge of the \\nabettor and with no other. \\n\\n111. Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done.—When an Act is abetted and \\na different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent as if \\nhe had directly abetted it: \\n\\nProvided  the  act  done  was  a  probable  consequence  of  the  abetment,  and  was  committed  under  the \\ninfluence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the abetment. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. The \\nchild, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y, which is by the side \\nof that of Z. Here, if the child was acting under the influence of A\\'s instigation, and the act done was under \\nthe circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable in the same manner and to the same \\nextent as if he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to burn Z’s house B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of \\nproperty there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for \\nthe theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning. \\n\\n(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and \\nprovides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the \\ninmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the \\npunishment provided for murder. \\n\\n112. Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done.—If the act \\nfor which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committed in addition to the act abetted, \\nand constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences. \\n\\nA instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence, resists that distress. In offering the \\nresistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the distress. As B has committed both the offence of resisting \\nthe distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and, if A knew \\nthat B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each of the \\noffences. \\n\\n113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different from that intended by \\nthe abettor.—When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular \\neffect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a different effect \\nfrom that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in the same manner and to the \\nsame extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the \\nact abetted was likely to cause that effect. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA  instigates  B  to  cause  grievous  hurt  to  Z.  B,  in  consequence  of  the  instigation,  causes  grievous  hurt  to  Z.  Z  dies  in \\nconsequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the punishment \\nprovided for murder. \\n\\n114. Abettor present when offence is committed.—Whenever any person, who is absent would be \\nliable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in \\nconsequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence. \\n\\n \\n\\n32 \\n\\n\\x0c115.  Abetment  of  offence  punishable  with  death  or  imprisonment  for  life.—if  offence  not \\ncommitted.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for \\nlife, shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is \\nmade  by  this  Code  for  the  punishment  of  such  abetment,  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either \\ndescription for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine; \\n\\nif  act  causing  harm  be  done  in  consequence.—and  if  any  act  for  which  the  abettor  is  liable  in \\nconsequence of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable to \\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be liable \\nto fine. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA instigates B to murder Z. The offence is not committed. If B had murdered Z, he would have been subject to the punishment \\nof death or imprisonment for life. Therefore A is liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and also to \\na fine; and if any hurt be done to Z in consequence of the abetment, he will be liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend \\nto fourteen years, and to fine. \\n\\n116. Abetment of offence punishable with imprisonment—if offence be not committed.—Whoever \\nabets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of \\nthe  abetment,  and  no  express  provision  is  made  by  this  Code  for  the  punishment  of  such  abetment,  be \\npunished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence for a term which may extend to \\none-fourth  part  of  the  longest  term  provided  for  that  offence;  or  with  such  fine  as  is  provided  for  that \\noffence, or with both; \\n\\nif abettor or person abetted be a public servant whose duty it is to prevent offence.—and if the \\nabettor or the person abetted is a public servant, whose duty it is to prevent the commission of such offence, \\nthe abettor shall be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence, for a term \\nwhich may extend to one-half of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such fine as is provided \\nfor the offence, or with both. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing. A somefavour in the exercise of B’s official functions. B \\n\\nrefuses to accept the bribe. A is punishable under this section. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. Here, if B does not give false evidence, A has nevertheless committed the offence \\n\\ndefined in this section, and is punishable accordingly. \\n\\n(c) A, a police-officer, whose duty it is to prevent robbery, abets the commission of robbery. Here, though the robbery be not \\n\\ncommitted, A is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for that offence, and also to fine. \\n\\n(d) B abets the commission of a robbery by A, a police-officer, whose duty it is to prevent that offence. Here, though the \\nrobbery be not committed, B is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for the offence of robbery, and also \\nto fine. \\n\\n117. Abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than ten persons.—Whoever abets \\nthe commission of an offence by the public generally or by any number or class of persons exceeding ten, \\nshall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or \\nwith fine, or with both. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA affixes in a public place a placard instigating a sect consisting of more than ten members to meet at a certain time and place, \\nfor the purpose of attacking the members of an adverse sect, while engaged in a procession. A has committed the offence defined \\nin this section. \\n\\n118.  Concealing  design  to  commit  offence  punishable  with  death  or  imprisonment  for  life.—\\nWhoever intending to facilitate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby facilitate the commission of \\nan offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                           \\n1.

A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient \\nin the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring \\nunder any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here \\nA, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury \\nas in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. \\n\\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. \\n\\nZ dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z\\'s death. \\n\\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although \\n\\nhe may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. \\n\\nException  1.—When  culpable  homicide  is  not  murder.—Culpable  homicide  is  not  murder  if  the \\noffender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death \\nof the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. \\n\\nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos:— \\n\\nFirst.—That the  provocation  is  not  sought  or  voluntarily  provoked  by  the offender as an  excuse for \\n\\nkilling or doing harm to any person. \\n\\nSecondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public \\n\\nservant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. \\n\\nThirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private \\n\\ndefence. \\n\\n \\n\\n73 \\n\\n\\x0cExplanation.—Whether  the  provocation  was  grave  and  sudden  enough  to  prevent  the  offence  from \\n\\namounting to murder is a question of fact. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z\\'s child. This is murder, \\ninasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in \\ndoing an act caused by the provocation. \\n\\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing \\nhimself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable \\nhomicide. \\n\\n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, \\n\\ninasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. \\n\\n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A\\'s deposition, and that A has \\n\\nperjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. \\n\\n(e)A attempts to pull Z\\'s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. \\nA is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by \\na thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. \\n\\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B\\'s rage, and to \\ncause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B\\'s hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable \\nhomicide, but A is guilty of murder. \\n\\nException 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the right \\nof private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of \\nthe person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any \\nintention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. \\nA  believing  in  good  faith  that  he  can  by  no  other  means  prevent  himself  from  being  horsewhipped,  shoots  Z  dead.  A  has  not \\ncommitted murder, but only culpable homicide. \\n\\nException 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public \\nservant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes \\ndeath by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of \\nhis duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused. \\n\\nException 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden \\nfight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender\\'s having taken undue advantage \\nor acted in a cruel or unusual manner. \\n\\nExplanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first \\n\\nassault. \\n\\nException 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above \\n\\nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z\\'s youth, \\n\\nhe was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder. \\n\\n301.  Culpable  homicide  by  causing  death  of  person  other  than  person  whose  death  was \\nintended.—If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, commits \\nculpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither intends nor knows himself \\nto be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of which it \\nwould have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or knew himself to he \\nlikely to cause. \\n\\n \\n\\n74 \\n\\n\\x0c302.  Punishment  for  murder.—Whoever  commits  murder  shall  be  punished  with  death  or \\n\\nimprisonment for life,  and shall also be liable to fine. \\n\\n303. Punishment for murder by life-convict.—Whoever, being under sentence of imprisonment for \\n\\nlife, commits murder, shall be punished with death. \\n\\n304. Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.—Whoever commits culpable \\nhomicide not amounting to murder, shall be punished with  imprisonment for life, or imprisonment of \\neither description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by \\nwhich the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is \\nlikely to cause death; \\n\\nor with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or \\nwith both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to \\ncause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. \\n\\n304A. Causing death by negligence.—Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash \\nor  negligent  act  not  amounting  to  culpable  homicide,  shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either \\ndescription for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. \\n\\nHimachal Pradesh.— \\n\\nSTATE AMENDMENTS \\n\\nAfter Section 304 A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860,  in its application to the State of Himachal \\n\\nPradesh, the following section shall be added, namely: — \\n\\n“304-AA.

Force.—A  person  is  said  to  use  force  to  another  if  he  causes  motion,  change  of  motion,  or \\ncessation of motion to that other, or if he causes to any substance such motion, or change of motion, or \\ncessation of motion as brings that substance into contact with any part of that other\\'s body, or with anything \\nwhich that other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so situated that such contact affects that other\\'s \\nsense of feeling: Provided that the person causing the motion, or change of motion, or cessation of motion, \\ncauses that motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion in one of the three ways hereinafter described: \\n\\nFirst.—By his own bodily power. \\n\\nSecondly.—By disposing any substance in such a manner that the motion or change or cessation of \\n\\nmotion takes place without any further act on his part, or on the part of any other person. \\n\\nThirdly.—By inducing any animal to move, to change its motion, or to cease to move. \\n\\n350. Criminal force.—Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person\\'s consent, \\nin order to the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force to cause, or knowing it to \\nbe likely that by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the \\nforce is used, is said to use criminal force to that other. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the \\nstream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is \\nproduced without any other action on any person\\'s part. A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without \\nZ\\'s consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will cause injury, \\nfear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z\\'s horses, and thereby causes them to quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of \\nmotion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z\\'s \\nconsent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of \\nmotion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, \\nwithout Z\\'s consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his own person so as to bring it \\ninto contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z\\'s consent, intending or knowing \\nit to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z\\'s \\nclothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z\\'s clothes or something carried \\nby Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z\\'s clothes, A \\nhas used force to Z, and if he did so without Z\\'s consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force \\nto Z. \\n\\n(f) A intentionally pulls up a Woman\\'s veil. Here  A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does so without her consent \\n\\nintending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her. \\n\\n(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by his own bodily power \\ncauses such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact \\nmust affect Z\\'s sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without Z\\'s consent intending \\nor knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force. \\n\\n(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z\\'s consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses \\n\\ncriminal force to Z. \\n\\n \\n\\n82 \\n\\n\\x0c351. Assault.—Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely \\nthat such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture \\nor preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault. \\n\\nExplanation.—Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give \\nto his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an \\nassault. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike \\n\\nZ. A has committed an assault. \\n\\n(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to \\n\\nbelieve that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A has committed an assault upon Z. \\n\\n(c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, “I will give you a beating”. Here, though the words used by A could in no case amount to \\nan assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault,the gesture \\nexplained by the words may amount to an assault. \\n\\n352. Punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation.—Whoever \\nassaults or uses criminal force to any person otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation given by that \\nperson, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three \\nmonths, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both. \\n\\nExplanation.—Grave and sudden provocation will not mitigate the punishment for an offence under \\nthis  section,  if  the  provocation  is  sought  or  voluntarily  provoked  by  the  offender  as  an  excuse  for  the \\noffence, or \\n\\nif the provocation is given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant, in the \\n\\nlawful exercise of the powers of such public servant, or \\n\\nif the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. \\n\\n Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate the offence, is a question of fact. \\n\\n353.  Assault  or  criminal  force  to  deter  public  servant  from  discharge  of  his  duty.—Whoever \\nassaults or uses criminal force to any person being a public servant in the execution of his duty as such \\npublic servant, or with intent to prevent or deter that person from discharging his duty as such public servant, \\nor in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by such person to the lawful discharge of his \\nduty as such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which \\nmay extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. \\n\\nSTATE AMENDMENT \\n\\nAmendment of section 353 of 45 of 1860.—In section 353 of the said Code, for the words “two years” \\n\\nMaharashtra.— \\n\\nthe words “five years” shall be substituted. \\n\\n[Vide Maharashtra Act 40 of 2018, sec. 3] \\n\\n354.

Theft.—Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of \\nany person without that person\\'s consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit \\ntheft. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the \\nsubject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft. \\n\\nExplanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it \\n\\nfrom moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. \\n\\nExplanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, \\n\\nand to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. \\n\\nExplanation 5.—The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be given \\neither by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or \\nimplied. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A cuts down a tree on Z\\'s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent. \\n\\nHere, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft. \\n\\n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z\\'s dog to follow it. Here, if A\\'s intention be dishonestly to take the \\n\\ndog out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z\\'s dog has begun to follow A. \\n\\n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly \\n\\ntake the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. \\n\\n(d) A being Z\\'s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z\\'s plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z\\'s consent. \\n\\nA has committed theft. \\n\\n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith \\nand sells it. Here the plate was not in Z\\'s possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z\\'s possession, and A has not committed \\ntheft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. \\n\\n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z\\'s possession, and if A dishonestly \\n\\nremoves it, A commits theft. \\n\\ncommit criminal misappropriation of property. \\n\\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may \\n\\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z\\'s house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear \\nof search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention \\nof taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first  moving the ring, \\ncommits theft. \\n\\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for \\nwhich the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z\\'s hand, \\nand carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as \\nwhat he did was not done dishonestly.  \\n\\n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the \\nwatch out of Z\\'s possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch \\nas he takes it dishonestly. \\n\\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent, not having paid what he \\n\\nborrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \\n\\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains \\n\\nmoney from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. \\n\\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z\\'s library in Z\\'s absence, and takes away a book without Z\\'s express consent \\nfor the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he \\nhad Z\\'s implied consent to use Z\\'s book. If this was A\\'s impression, A has not committed theft. \\n\\n(n) A asks charity from Z\\'s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is \\nprobable that A may conceive that Z\\'s wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A\\'s impression, A has not committed theft. \\n\\n(o) A is the paramour of Z\\'s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such \\n\\nproperty as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. \\n\\n \\n\\n95 \\n\\n\\x0c(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A\\'s own property, takes that property out of B\\'s possession. Here, \\n\\nas A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. \\n\\n379.

A has committed the offence defined in this section. \\n\\n(b)  A  picks  Z\\'s  pocket,  having posted  several  of  his  companions near  him,  in order that they  may  restrain  Z,  if  Z  should \\nperceive what is passing and should resist, or should attempt to apprehend A.

Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). \\n\\n \\n\\n99 \\n\\n\\x0cIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A takes property belonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession, in good faith believing at the time when he takes it, that the property \\nbelongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own \\nuse, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\n(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z\\'s library in Z\\'s absence, and takes away a book without Z\\'s express consent. \\nHere, if  A  was under the impression that he had Z\\'s implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has not \\ncommitted theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\n(c) A and B, being, joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B\\'s possession, intending to use it. Here, as A has a right \\nto use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it.

A, in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum \\n\\n1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.  \\n\\n(b) A, without Z\\'s authority, affixes Z\\'s seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling \\n\\nthe estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently \\n\\nfills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery. \\n\\n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable and authorizes B to fill up the cheque \\nby inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting \\nthe sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery. \\n\\n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B\\'s authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and \\nintending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the \\nsecurity of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery. \\n\\n(f) Z\\'s will contains these words—“I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B and C.” A dishonestly scratches \\n\\nout B\\'s name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. The words “TRADE OR” omitted by Act 43 of 1958, s. 135 and Sch. (w.e.f. 25-11-1959). \\n2.

Subs. by Act 10 of 2009, s. 51, for “digital signature” (w.e.f. 27-10-2009). \\n\\n \\n\\n109 \\n\\n\\x0c(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words “Pay to Z or his order” \\nand signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank \\nendorsement. B commits forgery. \\n\\n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated \\nsix months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. \\nA has committed forgery. \\n\\n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will \\n\\naccording to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B\\'s name without B\\'s authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances \\nfrom unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order \\nto induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(k) A without B\\'s authority writes a letter and signs it in B\\'s name certifying to A\\'s character, intending thereby to obtain employment under \\nZ. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or \\nimplied contract for service. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. \\n\\nA has committed forgery. \\n\\n(b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z\\'s name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of \\nexchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws \\nthe bill upon the paper pursuant to A\\'s intention, B is also guilty of forgery. \\n\\n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending \\n\\nto cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of \\nthe estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it \\nto be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it. \\n\\n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A\\'s benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to give \\na colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it \\nmay be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictious person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by \\na real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount \\nto forgery. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it. \\nA commits forgery. \\n\\nExplanation 3.—For the purposes of this section, the expression “affixing electronic signature” shall have the \\nmeaning assigned to it in clause (d) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (21 of \\n2000).] \\n\\n465.

As the effect of this endorsement is to transfer the right to the bill to any \\n\\nperson who may become the unlawful holder of it, the endorsement is a “valuable security”.  \\n\\n31. “A will”.—The words “a will” denote any testamentary document. \\n\\n32.

Effect caused partly by act and partly by omission.—Wherever the causing of a certain effect, \\nor an attempt to cause that effect, by an act or by an omission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the \\ncausing of that effect partly by an act and partly by an omission is the same offence. \\n\\nA intentionally causes Z\\'s death, partly by illegally omitting to give Z food, and party by beating Z. A has committed murder. \\n\\n37.  Co-operation  by  doing  one  of  several  acts  constituting  an  offence.—When  an  offence  is \\ncommitted by means of several acts, whoever intentionally co-operates in the commission of that offence \\nby doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence. \\n\\n(a) A and B agree to murder Z by severally and at different times giving him small doses of poison. A and B administer the \\npoison according to the agreement with intent to murder Z. Z dies from the effects the several doses of poison so administered to \\nhim. Here A and B intentionally cooperate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is \\ncaused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate. \\n\\n(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours at a time. A and B, \\nintending  to  cause  Z\\'s  death,  knowingly  co-operate  in  causing  that  effect  by  illegally  omitting,  each  during  the  time  of  his \\nattendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose. Z dies of hunger. Both A and B are guilty of the murder of Z. \\n\\n(c)  A,  a  jailor,  has  the  charge  of  Z,  a  prisoner.  A,  intending  to  cause  Z\\'s  death,  illegally  omits  to  supply  Z  with  food;  in \\nconsequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from his \\noffice, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or co-operation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is \\nlikely thereby to cause Z\\'s death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not co-operate with B. A is guilty only of \\nan attempt to commit murder. \\n\\n38. Persons concerned in criminal act may be guilty of different offences.—Where several persons \\nare engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different offences by \\nmeans of that act. \\n\\nA  attacks  Z  under  such  circumstances  of  grave  provocation  that  his  killing  of  Z  would  be  only  culpable  homicide  not \\namounting to murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and intending to kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, assists \\nA in killing Z.

Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself, justified, by law.—\\nNothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Subs. by Act 8 of 1862, s. 5, for “be less than a”. \\n2. Subs. by Act 3 of 1910, s. 2, for section 75. \\n3. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A. O. 1948, the A.

A, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, of the \\npower which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in the fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper \\nauthorities. A has committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in self-defence. \\n\\n80. Accident in doing a lawful act.—Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, \\nand without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful \\nmeans and with proper care and caution. \\n\\nA is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here, if there was no want of proper caution \\n\\non the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence. \\n\\n81.  Act  likely  to  cause  harm,  but  done without  criminal intent,  and  to  prevent  other  harm.—\\nNothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause harm, \\nif it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of preventing \\nor avoiding other harm to person or property. \\n\\nExplanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was \\nof such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that it \\nwas likely to cause harm. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly, and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a position \\nthat, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless  he \\nchanges the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with only two \\npassengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in \\ngood faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run \\ndown the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger \\nwhich he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C. \\n\\n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention \\nin good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so \\nimminent as to excuse A\\'s act, A is not guilty of the offence. \\n\\n82. Act of a child under seven years of age.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under \\n\\nseven years of age.  \\n\\n83.  Act  of  a  child  above  seven  and  under  twelve  of  immature  understanding.—Nothing  is  an \\noffence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under twelve, who has not attained sufficient \\nmaturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion. \\n\\n84. Act of a person of unsound mind.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the \\ntime of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he \\nis doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. \\n\\n85. Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will.—\\nNothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, \\nincapable  of  knowing  the  nature  of  the  act,  or  that  he  is  doing  what  is  either  wrong,  or  contrary  to  \\nlaw;  provided  that  the  thing  which  intoxicated  him  was  administered  to  him  without  his  knowledge  or \\nagainst his will. \\n\\n86. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.—In \\ncases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person who \\ndoes the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge as he \\nwould have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was administered to \\nhim without his knowledge or against his will. \\n\\n87.  Act  not  intended  and  not  known  to  be  likely  to  cause  death  or  grievous  hurt,  done  by \\nconsent.—Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the \\ndoer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, \\nor be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has given consent, \\n\\n \\n\\n25 \\n\\n\\x0cwhether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the \\ndoer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm. \\n\\nA and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which, \\n\\nin the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence. \\n\\n88. Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person\\'s benefit.—Nothing, \\nwhich is not intented to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended \\nby the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is \\ndone in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm, or to take \\nthe risk of that harm. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who suffers under the painful complaint, \\nbut not intending to cause Z\\'s death, and intending, in good faith, Z\\'s benefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z\\'s consent. A has \\ncommitted no offence. \\n\\n89. Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, by or by consent of guardian.—\\nNothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or of unsound \\nmind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of \\nthat person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause or \\nbe known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: Provided— \\n\\nProvisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or to the \\n\\nattempting to cause death; \\n\\nSecondly.—That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing it \\nknows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, \\nor the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\n\\nThirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the \\nattempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or \\nthe curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\n\\nFourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing \\n\\nof which offence it would not extend. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, in good faith, for his child\\'s benefit without his child\\'s consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon knowing it to \\nbe likely that the operation will cause the child\\'s death, but not intending to cause the child\\'s death. A is within the exception,  \\ninasmuch as his object was the cure of the child. \\n\\n90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.—A consent is not such a consent as is \\nintended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a \\nmisconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent was \\ngiven in consequence of such fear or misconception; or \\n\\nConsent of insane person.—if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or \\n\\nintoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or \\n\\nConsent of child.—unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person \\n\\nwho is under twelve years of age. \\n\\n91. Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm cause.—The exceptions in sections \\n87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they may cause, \\nor be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or on whose \\nbehalf the consent is given. \\n\\nCausing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is offence independently of \\nany harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”; and \\nthe consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\n26 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c92. Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.—Nothing is an offence by reason \\nof any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without that \\nperson\\'s consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, or if \\nthat person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of him from \\nwhom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided— \\n\\nProvisos.  First.—That  this  exception  shall  not  extend  to  the  intentional  causing  of  death,  or  the \\n\\nattempting to cause death; \\n\\nSecondly.—That this exception shall not extend  to the doing of anything which the person doing it \\nknows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or \\nthe curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\n\\nThirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to \\n\\ncause hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt; \\n\\nFourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing of \\n\\nwhich offence it would not extend. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be trepanned. A, not intending Z\\'s death, \\nbut in good faith, for Z\\'s benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed no \\noffence. \\n\\n(b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill Z, but not intending to kill Z, \\n\\nand in good faith intending Z\\'s benefit. A\\'s ball gives Z a mortal wound. A has committed no offence. \\n\\n(c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an operation be immediately performed. \\nThere is not time to apply to the child\\'s guardian. A performs the operation in spite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in good \\nfaith, the child\\'s benefit. A has committed no offence. \\n\\n(d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A drops the child from the house stop, \\nknowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child\\'s \\nbenefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence. \\n\\nExplanation.—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 88, 89 and 92. \\n\\n93. Communication made in good faith.—No communication made in good faith is an offence by \\n\\nreason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live. The patient dies in consequence of the \\n\\nshock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient\\'s death. \\n\\n94. Act to which a person is compelled by threats.—Except murder, and offences against the State \\npunishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, \\nwhich,  at  the  time  of  doing  it,  reasonably  cause  the  apprehension  that  instant  death  to  that  person  will \\notherwise  be  the  consequence:  Provided  the  person  doing  the  act  did  not  of  his  own  accord,  or  from  a \\nreasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which \\nhe became subject to such constraint. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins a gang \\nof dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the ground of his \\nhaving been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant death, to do a \\nthing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of \\na house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception. \\n\\n95. Act causing slight harm.—Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to \\ncause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of ordinary \\nsense and temper would complain of such harm. \\n\\n96. Things done in private defence.—Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right \\n\\n \\nOf the Right of Private Defence \\n\\n27 \\n\\nof private defence. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c97. Right of private defence of the body and of property.—Every person has a right, subject to the \\n\\nrestrictions contained in section 99, to defend— \\n\\nFirst.—His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human body; \\n\\nSecondly.—The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against \\nany act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or \\nwhich is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass. \\n\\n98. Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc.—When an act, which \\nwould otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of maturity of \\nunderstanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by reason of any \\nmisconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence against that act \\nwhich he would have if the act were that offence. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. But A has the same right of private defence \\n\\nwhich he would have if Z were sane. \\n\\n(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A. \\nHere Z, by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z, which \\nhe would have if Z were not acting under that misconception. \\n\\n99. Acts against which there is no right of private defence.—There is no right of private defence \\nagainst an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or \\nattempted to be done, by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that act, \\nmay not be strictly justifiable by law. \\n\\nThere is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension \\nof death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant acting in \\ngood faith under colour of his office, though that direction may not be strictly justifiable by law. \\n\\nThere is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to protection of the \\n\\npublic authorities. \\n\\nExtent to which the right may be exercised.—The right of private defence in no case extends to the \\n\\ninflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence. \\n\\nExplanation  1.—A  person  is  not  deprived  of  the  right  of  private  defence  against  an  act  done,  or \\nattempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows or has reason to believe, that the person \\ndoing the act is such public servant. \\n\\nExplanation  2.—A  person  is  not  deprived  of  the  right  of  private  defence  against  an  act  done,  or \\nattempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that \\nthe person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such person states the authority under which \\nhe acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded. \\n\\n100. When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death.—The right of private \\ndefence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section, to the voluntary \\ncausing of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the offence which occasions the exercise of the \\nright be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:— \\n\\nFirst.—Such  an  assault  as  may  reasonably  cause  the  apprehension  that  death  will  otherwise  be  the \\n\\nconsequence of such assault; \\n\\nbe the consequence of such assault; \\n\\nSecondly.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise \\n\\nThirdly.—An assault with the intention of committing rape; \\n\\nFourthly.—An assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust; \\n\\nFifthly.—An assault with the intention of kidnapping or abducting; \\n\\nSixthly.—An assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under circumstances which \\nmay reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the public authorities for \\nhis release. \\n\\n \\n\\n28 \\n\\n\\x0cSeventhly.—An act of throwing or administering acid or an attempt to throw or administer acid which \\nmay reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such act. \\n\\n101. When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.—If the offence be not of any \\nof the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, the right of private defence of the body does \\nnot  extend  to  the  voluntary  causing  of  death  to  the  assailant,  but  does  extend,  under  the  restrictions \\nmentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death. \\n\\n102. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body.—The right of \\nprivate defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises \\nfrom an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed; and it \\ncontinues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues. \\n\\n103. When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death.—The right of private \\ndefence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the  voluntary causing of \\ndeath or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to \\ncommit  which,  occasions  the  exercise  of  the  right,  be  an  offence  of  any  of  the  descriptions  hereinafter \\nenumerated, namely:— \\n\\nFirst.—Robbery; \\n\\nSecondly.—House-breaking by night; \\n\\nThirdly.—Mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is \\n\\nused as a human dwelling, or as a place for the custody of property; \\n\\nFourthly.—Theft,  mischief,  or  house-trespass,  under  such  circumstances  as  may  reasonably  cause \\napprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of private defence is not \\nexercised. \\n\\nSTATE AMENDMENTS \\n\\nKarnataka \\n\\n(1) In section 103, in clause Thirdly, — \\n\\n(i) after the words “mischief by fire”, the words “or any explosive substance” Shall be inserted; \\n\\n(ii) after the words “as a human dwelling, or”the words “as a place of worship, or” shall be inserted. \\n\\n(2) After clause Fourthly, the following clause shall be inserted namely:— \\n\\n“Fifthly.— Mischief by fire or any explosive substance committed on any property used or intended to \\nbe  used  for  the  purpose  of  Government  or  any  local  authority,  statutory  body  or  company  owned  or \\ncontrolled by Government or railway or any vehicle used or adapted to be used for the carriage of passengers \\nfor hire or reward”. \\n\\n[Vide Karnataka Act 8 of 1972, sec. 2]. \\n\\n104.  When  such  right  extends  to  causing  any  harm  other  than  death.—If  the  offence,  the \\ncommitting  of  which,  or  the  attempting  to  commit  which  occasions  the  exercise  of  the  right  of  private \\ndefence,  be  theft,  mischief,  or  criminal  trespass,  not  of  any  of  the  descriptions  enumerated  in  the  last \\npreceding section, that right does not extend to the voluntary causing of death, but does extend, subject to \\nthe restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the wrong-doer of any harm other than \\ndeath. \\n\\n105. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of property.—The right of \\nprivate  defence  of  property  commences  when  a  reasonable  apprehension  of  danger  to  the  property \\ncommences. \\n\\nThe right of private defence of property against theft continues till the offender has effected his retreat \\nwith  the  property  or  either  the  assistance  of the public  authorities is  obtained,  or  the property  has  been \\nrecovered. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Ins. by Act 13 of 2013, s. 2 (w.e.f. 3-2-2013). \\n\\n29 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cThe right of private defence of property against robbery continues as long as the offender causes or \\nattempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or as long as the fear of instant death or \\nof instant hurt or of instant personal restraint continues. \\n\\nThe right of private defence of property against criminal trespass or mischief continues as long as the \\n\\noffender continues in the commission of criminal trespass or mischief. \\n\\nThe right of private defence of property against house-breaking by night continues as long as the house-\\n\\ntrespass which has been begun by such house-breaking continues. \\n\\n106.  Right  of  private  defence  against  deadly  assault  when  there  is  risk  of  harm  to  innocent \\nperson.—If in the exercise of the right of private defence against an assault which reasonably causes the \\napprehension of death, the defender be so situated that he cannot effectually exercise that right without risk \\nof harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of that risk. \\n\\nA is attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his right of private defence without firing \\non the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children who are mingled with the mob. A commits no offence if by \\nso firing he harms any of the children. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nCHAPTER V \\n\\nOF ABETMENT \\n\\n107. Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the doing of a thing, who— \\n\\nFirst.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or \\n\\nSecondly.—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that \\nthing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of \\nthat thing; or \\n\\nThirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material \\nfact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing \\nto be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z, B, knowing that fact and also that C is \\nnot Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the \\napprehension of C. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in \\norder to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid \\nthe doing of that act. \\n\\n108.  Abettor.—A  person  abets  an  offence,  who  abets  either  the  commission  of  an  offence,  or  the \\ncommission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing \\nan offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence although the \\n\\nabettor may not himself be bound to do that act. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should be \\n\\ncommitted, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of instigating \\n\\nB to commit murder. \\n\\nExplanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an \\noffence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty \\nintention or knowledge. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n30 \\n\\n\\x0cIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person \\ncapable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is \\nguilty of abetting an offence. \\n\\n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z\\'s death. \\nB, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z\\'s death. Here, though B was not capable \\nby law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an \\noffence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. \\n\\n(c)  A  instigates  B  to  set  fire  to  a  dwelling-house.  B,  in  consequence  of  the  unsoundness  of  his  mind,  being  incapable  of \\nknowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A\\'s \\ninstigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to \\nthe punishment provided for that offence. \\n\\n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession. A induces \\nB to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z\\'s possession, in good faith, believing it to be A\\'s property. \\nB, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, \\nand is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. \\n\\nExplanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also \\n\\nan offence. \\n\\nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence \\nof B\\'s instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the \\noffence, A is also liable to the same punishment. \\n\\nExplanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that \\nthe abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the \\nconspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. \\n\\nA  concerts  with  B  a  plan  for  poisoning  Z.  It  is  agreed  that  A  shall  administer  the  poison.  B  then  explains  the  plan  to  C \\nmentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A\\'s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and \\nprocures  and  delivers  it  to  B  for  the  purpose  of  its  being  used  in  the  manner  explained.  A  administers  the  poison;  Z  dies  in \\nconsequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which \\nZ has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder. \\n\\n108A. Abetment in India of offences outside India.—A person abets an offence within the meaning \\nof this Code who, in India, abets the commission of any act without and beyond  India which would \\nconstitute an offence if committed in India. \\n\\nA, in India, instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa, A is guilty of abetting murder.] \\n\\n109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express \\nprovision is made for its punishment.—Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed \\nin consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such \\nabetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. \\n\\nExplanation.—An  act  or  offence  is  said  to  be  committed  in  consequence  of  abetment,  when  it  is \\ncommitted  in  consequence  of  the  instigation,  or  in  pursuance  of  the  conspiracy,  or  with  the  aid  which \\nconstitutes the abetment. \\n\\n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the exercise of B\\'s official functions. B \\n\\naccepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined in section 161. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Added by Act 4 of 1898, s. 3. \\n2. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A.O. 1948, the A.O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch., to \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n31 \\n\\nread as above. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting \\n\\nthat offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B. \\n\\n(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he \\nmay administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A’s absence and thereby causes Z’s death. \\nHere B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder. \\n\\n110.  Punishment  of  abetment  if  person  abetted  does  act  with  different  intention  from  that  of \\nabettor.—Whoever  abets the  commission of  an  offence  shall,  if the  person  abetted  does  the  act  with  a \\ndifferent intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for the \\noffence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge of the \\nabettor and with no other. \\n\\n111. Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done.—When an Act is abetted and \\na different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent as if \\nhe had directly abetted it: \\n\\nProvided  the  act  done  was  a  probable  consequence  of  the  abetment,  and  was  committed  under  the \\ninfluence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the abetment. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. The \\nchild, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y, which is by the side \\nof that of Z. Here, if the child was acting under the influence of A\\'s instigation, and the act done was under \\nthe circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable in the same manner and to the same \\nextent as if he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to burn Z’s house B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of \\nproperty there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for \\nthe theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning. \\n\\n(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and \\nprovides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the \\ninmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the \\npunishment provided for murder. \\n\\n112. Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done.—If the act \\nfor which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committed in addition to the act abetted, \\nand constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences. \\n\\nA instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence, resists that distress. In offering the \\nresistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the distress. As B has committed both the offence of resisting \\nthe distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and, if A knew \\nthat B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each of the \\noffences. \\n\\n113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different from that intended by \\nthe abettor.—When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular \\neffect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a different effect \\nfrom that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in the same manner and to the \\nsame extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the \\nact abetted was likely to cause that effect. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA  instigates  B  to  cause  grievous  hurt  to  Z.  B,  in  consequence  of  the  instigation,  causes  grievous  hurt  to  Z.  Z  dies  in \\nconsequence.

Culpable homicide.—Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, \\nor with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he \\nis likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide. \\n\\n(a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to \\nbe thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable \\nhomicide. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Ins. by Act 25 of 1927, s. 2. \\n2. Subs. by the A. O. 1950, for “His Majesty’s subjects”. \\n3. Subs. by Act 41 of 1961, s. 3, for certain words. \\n4. Subs. by s. 3, ibid., for “two years”. \\n\\n \\n\\n72 \\n\\n\\x0c(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z\\'s death, \\ninduces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable \\nhomicide. \\n\\n(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. Here, \\nalthough A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause death by \\ndoing an act that he knew was likely to cause death. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, disease \\nor bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused his death. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury shall \\nbe deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment the \\ndeath might have been prevented. \\n\\nExplanation 3.—The causing of the death of a child in the mother\\'s womb is not homicide. But it may \\namount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought \\nforth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born. \\n\\n300. Murder.—Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by \\n\\nwhich the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or— \\n\\n2ndly.—If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely \\n\\nto cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or— \\n\\n3rdly.—If  it  is  done  with the  intention  of  causing  bodily  injury  to  any  person  and  the  bodily  injury \\n\\nintended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or— \\n\\n4thly.—If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all \\nprobability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any \\nexcuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. \\n\\n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention \\nof causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient \\nin the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring \\nunder any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here \\nA, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury \\nas in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. \\n\\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. \\n\\nZ dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z\\'s death. \\n\\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although \\n\\nhe may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. \\n\\nException  1.—When  culpable  homicide  is  not  murder.—Culpable  homicide  is  not  murder  if  the \\noffender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death \\nof the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. \\n\\nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos:— \\n\\nFirst.—That the  provocation  is  not  sought  or  voluntarily  provoked  by  the offender as an  excuse for \\n\\nkilling or doing harm to any person. \\n\\nSecondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public \\n\\nservant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. \\n\\nThirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private \\n\\ndefence. \\n\\n \\n\\n73 \\n\\n\\x0cExplanation.—Whether  the  provocation  was  grave  and  sudden  enough  to  prevent  the  offence  from \\n\\namounting to murder is a question of fact. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z\\'s child. This is murder, \\ninasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in \\ndoing an act caused by the provocation. \\n\\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing \\nhimself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable \\nhomicide. \\n\\n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, \\n\\ninasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. \\n\\n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A\\'s deposition, and that A has \\n\\nperjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. \\n\\n(e)A attempts to pull Z\\'s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. \\nA is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by \\na thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. \\n\\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B\\'s rage, and to \\ncause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B\\'s hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable \\nhomicide, but A is guilty of murder. \\n\\nException 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the right \\nof private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of \\nthe person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any \\nintention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. \\nA  believing  in  good  faith  that  he  can  by  no  other  means  prevent  himself  from  being  horsewhipped,  shoots  Z  dead.  A  has  not \\ncommitted murder, but only culpable homicide. \\n\\nException 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public \\nservant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes \\ndeath by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of \\nhis duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused. \\n\\nException 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden \\nfight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender\\'s having taken undue advantage \\nor acted in a cruel or unusual manner. \\n\\nExplanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first \\n\\nassault. \\n\\nException 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above \\n\\nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z\\'s youth, \\n\\nhe was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder. \\n\\n301.  Culpable  homicide  by  causing  death  of  person  other  than  person  whose  death  was \\nintended.—If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, commits \\nculpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither intends nor knows himself \\nto be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of which it \\nwould have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or knew himself to he \\nlikely to cause. \\n\\n \\n\\n74 \\n\\n\\x0c302.  Punishment  for  murder.—Whoever  commits  murder  shall  be  punished  with  death  or \\n\\nimprisonment for life,  and shall also be liable to fine. \\n\\n303. Punishment for murder by life-convict.—Whoever, being under sentence of imprisonment for \\n\\nlife, commits murder, shall be punished with death. \\n\\n304. Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.—Whoever commits culpable \\nhomicide not amounting to murder, shall be punished with  imprisonment for life, or imprisonment of \\neither description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by \\nwhich the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is \\nlikely to cause death; \\n\\nor with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or \\nwith both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to \\ncause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. \\n\\n304A. Causing death by negligence.—Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash \\nor  negligent  act  not  amounting  to  culpable  homicide,  shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either \\ndescription for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. \\n\\nHimachal Pradesh.— \\n\\nSTATE AMENDMENTS \\n\\nAfter Section 304 A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860,  in its application to the State of Himachal \\n\\nPradesh, the following section shall be added, namely: — \\n\\n“304-AA.

A is \\n\\nliable to punishment under this section. \\n\\n(b) A, with the intention of causing the death of a child of tender years, exposes it in a desert place A has committed the \\n\\noffence defined by this section, though the death of the child does not ensue. \\n\\n(c) A, intending to murder Z, buys a gun and loads it.

Force.—A  person  is  said  to  use  force  to  another  if  he  causes  motion,  change  of  motion,  or \\ncessation of motion to that other, or if he causes to any substance such motion, or change of motion, or \\ncessation of motion as brings that substance into contact with any part of that other\\'s body, or with anything \\nwhich that other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so situated that such contact affects that other\\'s \\nsense of feeling: Provided that the person causing the motion, or change of motion, or cessation of motion, \\ncauses that motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion in one of the three ways hereinafter described: \\n\\nFirst.—By his own bodily power. \\n\\nSecondly.—By disposing any substance in such a manner that the motion or change or cessation of \\n\\nmotion takes place without any further act on his part, or on the part of any other person. \\n\\nThirdly.—By inducing any animal to move, to change its motion, or to cease to move. \\n\\n350. Criminal force.—Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person\\'s consent, \\nin order to the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force to cause, or knowing it to \\nbe likely that by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the \\nforce is used, is said to use criminal force to that other. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the \\nstream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is \\nproduced without any other action on any person\\'s part. A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without \\nZ\\'s consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will cause injury, \\nfear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z\\'s horses, and thereby causes them to quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of \\nmotion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z\\'s \\nconsent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of \\nmotion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, \\nwithout Z\\'s consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his own person so as to bring it \\ninto contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z\\'s consent, intending or knowing \\nit to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z\\'s \\nclothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z\\'s clothes or something carried \\nby Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z\\'s clothes, A \\nhas used force to Z, and if he did so without Z\\'s consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force \\nto Z. \\n\\n(f) A intentionally pulls up a Woman\\'s veil. Here  A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does so without her consent \\n\\nintending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her. \\n\\n(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by his own bodily power \\ncauses such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact \\nmust affect Z\\'s sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without Z\\'s consent intending \\nor knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force. \\n\\n(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z\\'s consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses \\n\\ncriminal force to Z. \\n\\n \\n\\n82 \\n\\n\\x0c351. Assault.—Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely \\nthat such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture \\nor preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault. \\n\\nExplanation.—Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give \\nto his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an \\nassault. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike \\n\\nZ. A has committed an assault. \\n\\n(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to \\n\\nbelieve that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A has committed an assault upon Z. \\n\\n(c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, “I will give you a beating”. Here, though the words used by A could in no case amount to \\nan assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault,the gesture \\nexplained by the words may amount to an assault. \\n\\n352. Punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation.—Whoever \\nassaults or uses criminal force to any person otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation given by that \\nperson, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three \\nmonths, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both. \\n\\nExplanation.—Grave and sudden provocation will not mitigate the punishment for an offence under \\nthis  section,  if  the  provocation  is  sought  or  voluntarily  provoked  by  the  offender  as  an  excuse  for  the \\noffence, or \\n\\nif the provocation is given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant, in the \\n\\nlawful exercise of the powers of such public servant, or \\n\\nif the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. \\n\\n Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate the offence, is a question of fact. \\n\\n353.  Assault  or  criminal  force  to  deter  public  servant  from  discharge  of  his  duty.—Whoever \\nassaults or uses criminal force to any person being a public servant in the execution of his duty as such \\npublic servant, or with intent to prevent or deter that person from discharging his duty as such public servant, \\nor in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by such person to the lawful discharge of his \\nduty as such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which \\nmay extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. \\n\\nSTATE AMENDMENT \\n\\nAmendment of section 353 of 45 of 1860.—In section 353 of the said Code, for the words “two years” \\n\\nMaharashtra.— \\n\\nthe words “five years” shall be substituted. \\n\\n[Vide Maharashtra Act 40 of 2018, sec. 3] \\n\\n354.

Theft.—Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of \\nany person without that person\\'s consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit \\ntheft. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the \\nsubject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft. \\n\\nExplanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it \\n\\nfrom moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. \\n\\nExplanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, \\n\\nand to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. \\n\\nExplanation 5.—The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be given \\neither by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or \\nimplied. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A cuts down a tree on Z\\'s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent. \\n\\nHere, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft. \\n\\n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z\\'s dog to follow it. Here, if A\\'s intention be dishonestly to take the \\n\\ndog out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z\\'s dog has begun to follow A. \\n\\n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly \\n\\ntake the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. \\n\\n(d) A being Z\\'s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z\\'s plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z\\'s consent. \\n\\nA has committed theft. \\n\\n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith \\nand sells it. Here the plate was not in Z\\'s possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z\\'s possession, and A has not committed \\ntheft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. \\n\\n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z\\'s possession, and if A dishonestly \\n\\nremoves it, A commits theft. \\n\\ncommit criminal misappropriation of property. \\n\\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may \\n\\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z\\'s house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear \\nof search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention \\nof taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first  moving the ring, \\ncommits theft. \\n\\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for \\nwhich the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z\\'s hand, \\nand carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as \\nwhat he did was not done dishonestly.  \\n\\n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the \\nwatch out of Z\\'s possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch \\nas he takes it dishonestly. \\n\\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent, not having paid what he \\n\\nborrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \\n\\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains \\n\\nmoney from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. \\n\\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z\\'s library in Z\\'s absence, and takes away a book without Z\\'s express consent \\nfor the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he \\nhad Z\\'s implied consent to use Z\\'s book. If this was A\\'s impression, A has not committed theft. \\n\\n(n) A asks charity from Z\\'s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is \\nprobable that A may conceive that Z\\'s wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A\\'s impression, A has not committed theft. \\n\\n(o) A is the paramour of Z\\'s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such \\n\\nproperty as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. \\n\\n \\n\\n95 \\n\\n\\x0c(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A\\'s own property, takes that property out of B\\'s possession. Here, \\n\\nas A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. \\n\\n379.

Robbery.—In all robbery there is either theft or extortion. \\n\\nOf Robbery and Dacoity \\n\\nWhen theft is robbery.—Theft is “robbery” if, in order to the committing of the theft, or in committing \\nthe theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft, the offender, for \\nthat end voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint, or fear of \\ninstant death or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint. \\n\\nWhen extortion is robbery.—Extortion is  “robbery” if the offender, at the time of committing the \\nextortion, is in the presence of the person put in fear, and commits the extortion by putting that person in \\nfear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint to that person or to some other person, \\nand, by so putting in fear, induces the person so put in fear then and there to deliver up the thing extorted. \\n\\nExplanation.—The offender is said to be present if he is sufficiently near to put the other person in fear \\n\\nof instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A holds Z down, and fraudulently takes Z\\'s money and jewels from Z\\'s clothes, without Z\\'s consent. Here A has committed \\ntheft,  and,  in  order  to  the  committing  of  that  theft,  has  voluntarily  caused  wrongful  restraint  to  Z.  A  has  therefore  committed \\nrobbery. \\n\\n(b) A meets Z on the high road, shows a pistol, and demands Z\\'s purse. Z, in consequence, surrenders his purse. Here A has \\nextorted the purse from Z by putting him in fear of instant hurt, and being at the time of committing the extortion in his presence. \\nA has therefore committed robbery. \\n\\n(c) A meets Z and Z\\'s child on the high road. A takes the child, and threatens to filing it down a precipice, unless Z delivers \\nhis purse. Z, in consequence, delivers his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z, by causing Z to be in fear of instant hurt to \\nthe child who is there present. A has therefore committed robbery on Z. \\n\\n(d) A obtains property from Z by saying “Your child is in the hands of my gang, and will be put to death unless you send us \\nten thousand rupees”. This is extortion, and punishable as such: but it is not robbery, unless Z is put in fear of the instant death of \\nhis child. \\n\\n391. Dacoity.—When five or more persons conjointly commit or attempt to commit a robbery, or where \\nthe whole number of persons conjointly committing or attempting to commit a robbery, and persons present \\n\\n                                                           \\n1.Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). \\n\\n \\n\\n98 \\n\\n\\x0cand aiding such commission or attempt, amount to five or more, every person so committing, attempting or \\naiding, is said to commit “dacoity”. \\n\\n392.

Dishonest misappropriation of property.—Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to \\nhis own use any movable property, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term \\nwhich may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). \\n\\n \\n\\n99 \\n\\n\\x0cIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A takes property belonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession, in good faith believing at the time when he takes it, that the property \\nbelongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own \\nuse, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\n(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z\\'s library in Z\\'s absence, and takes away a book without Z\\'s express consent. \\nHere, if  A  was under the impression that he had Z\\'s implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has not \\ncommitted theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\n(c) A and B, being, joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B\\'s possession, intending to use it. Here, as A has a right \\nto use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it. But, if A sells the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his own \\nuse, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation with the meaning \\n\\nof this section. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement. A, knowing that the note belongs to Z, \\npledges it with a banker as a security or a loan, intending at a future time to restore it to Z. A has committed an offence under this \\nsection. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—A person who finds property not in the possession of any other person, and takes such \\nproperty for the purpose of protecting it for, or of restoring it to, the owner, does not take or misappropriate \\nit dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he is guilty of the offence above defined, if he appropriates \\nit  to  his  own  use,  when  he  knows  or  has  the  means  of  discovering  the  owner,  or  before  he  has  used \\nreasonable means to discover and give notice to the owner and has kept the property a reasonable time to \\nenable the owner to claim it. \\n\\nWhat are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question of fact. \\n\\nIt is not necessary that the finder should know who is the owner of the property, or that any particular \\nperson is the owner of it; it is sufficient if, at the time of appropriating it, he does not believe it to be his \\nown property, or in good faith believe that the real owner cannot be found. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A finds a rupee on the high road, not knowing to whom the rupee belongs, A picks up the rupee. Here A has not committed \\n\\nthe offence defined in this section. \\n\\n(b) A finds a letter on the road, containing a bank note. From the direction and contents of the letter he learns to whom the \\n\\nnote belongs. He appropriates the note. He is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\n(c) A finds a cheque payable to bearer. He can form no conjecture as to the person who has lost the cheque. But the name of \\nthe person, who has drawn the cheque, appears. A knows that this person can direct him to the person in whose favour the cheque \\nwas drawn. A appropriates the cheque without attempting to discover the owner. He is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\n(d) A sees Z drop his purse with  money in it. A picks up the purse  with the intention of restoring it to Z, but afterwards \\n\\nappropriates it to his own use. A has committed an offence under this section. \\n\\n(e) A finds a purse with money, not knowing to whom it belongs; he afterwards discovers that it belongs to Z, and appropriates \\n\\nit to his own use. A is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\n(f) A finds a valuable ring, not knowing to whom it belongs. A sells it immediately without attempting to discover the owner. \\n\\nA is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\n404.  Dishonest  misappropriation  of  property  possessed  by  deceased  person  at  the  time  of  his \\ndeath.—Whoever  dishonestly  misappropriates  or  converts  to  his  own  use  property,  knowing  that  such \\nproperty was in the possession of a deceased person at the time of that person\\'s decease, and has not since \\nbeen  in  the  possession  of  any  person  legally  entitled  to  such  possession,  shall  be  punished  with \\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to \\nfine, and if the offender at the time of such person\\'s decease was employed by him as a clerk or servant, the \\nimprisonment may extend to seven years. \\n\\nZ dies in possession of furniture and money. His servant A, before the money comes into the possession of any person entitled \\n\\nto such possession, dishonestly misappropriates it. A has committed the offence defined in this section. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\n100 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cOf Criminal Breach of Trust \\n\\n405. Criminal breach of trust.—Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any \\ndominion  over  property,  dishonestly  misappropriates  or  converts  to  his  own  use  that  property,  or \\ndishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in \\nwhich  such  trust  is  to  be  discharged,  or  of  any  legal  contract,  express  or  implied,  which  he  has  made \\ntouching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do, commits “criminal breach \\nof trust”. \\n\\nExplanation  1.—A  person,  being  an  employer  of  an  establishment  whether  exempted  under \\nsection 17 of the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 (19 of 1952) or not \\nwho deducts the employee’s contribution from the wages payable to the employee for credit to a Provident \\nFund or Family Pension Fund established by any law for the time being in force, shall be deemed to have \\nbeen  entrusted  with  the  amount  of  the  contribution  so  deducted  by  him  and  if  he  makes  default  in  the \\npayment  of  such  contribution  to  the  said  Fund  in  violation  of  the  said  law,  shall  be  deemed  to  have \\ndishonestly used the amount of the said contribution in violation of a direction of law as aforesaid.] \\n\\nExplanation 2.—A person, being an employer, who deducts the employees’ contribution from the \\nwages payable to the employee for credit to the Employees’ State Insurance Fund held and administered \\nby the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation established under the Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948 \\n(34 of 1948), shall be deemed to have been entrusted with the amount of the contribution so deducted by \\nhim and if he makes default in the payment of such contribution to the said Fund in violation of the said \\nAct, shall be deemed to have dishonestly used the amount of the said contribution in violation of a direction \\nof law as aforesaid. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, being executor to the will of a deceased person, dishonestly disobeys the law which directs him to divide the effects \\n\\naccording to the will, and appropriates them to his own use.

A, in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum \\n\\n1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.  \\n\\n(b) A, without Z\\'s authority, affixes Z\\'s seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling \\n\\nthe estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently \\n\\nfills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery. \\n\\n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable and authorizes B to fill up the cheque \\nby inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting \\nthe sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery. \\n\\n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B\\'s authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and \\nintending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the \\nsecurity of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery. \\n\\n(f) Z\\'s will contains these words—“I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B and C.” A dishonestly scratches \\n\\nout B\\'s name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. The words “TRADE OR” omitted by Act 43 of 1958, s. 135 and Sch. (w.e.f. 25-11-1959). \\n2.

B dishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank \\nendorsement. B commits forgery. \\n\\n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated \\nsix months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. \\nA has committed forgery. \\n\\n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will \\n\\naccording to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B\\'s name without B\\'s authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances \\nfrom unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order \\nto induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(k) A without B\\'s authority writes a letter and signs it in B\\'s name certifying to A\\'s character, intending thereby to obtain employment under \\nZ. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or \\nimplied contract for service. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. \\n\\nA has committed forgery. \\n\\n(b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z\\'s name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of \\nexchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws \\nthe bill upon the paper pursuant to A\\'s intention, B is also guilty of forgery. \\n\\n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name.

As the effect of this endorsement is to transfer the right to the bill to any \\n\\nperson who may become the unlawful holder of it, the endorsement is a “valuable security”.  \\n\\n31. “A will”.—The words “a will” denote any testamentary document. \\n\\n32. Words referring to acts include illegal omissions.—In every part of this Code, except where a \\ncontrary intention appears from the context, words which refer to acts done extend also to illegal omissions. \\n\\n33. “Act”. “Omission”.—The word “act” denotes as well as series of acts as a single act: the word \\n\\n“omission” denotes as well a series of omissions as a single omission.  \\n\\n34. Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention.—When a criminal act is \\ndone by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for \\nthat act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone. \\n\\n35.  When  such  an  act  is  criminal  by  reason  of  its  being  done  with  a  criminal  knowledge  or \\nintention.—Whenever an act, which is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal knowledge \\nor intention, is done by several persons, each of such persons who joins in the act with such knowledge or \\nintention is liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone with that knowledge \\nor intention. \\n\\n36. Effect caused partly by act and partly by omission.—Wherever the causing of a certain effect, \\nor an attempt to cause that effect, by an act or by an omission, is an offence, it is to be understood that the \\ncausing of that effect partly by an act and partly by an omission is the same offence. \\n\\nA intentionally causes Z\\'s death, partly by illegally omitting to give Z food, and party by beating Z. A has committed murder. \\n\\n37.  Co-operation  by  doing  one  of  several  acts  constituting  an  offence.—When  an  offence  is \\ncommitted by means of several acts, whoever intentionally co-operates in the commission of that offence \\nby doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence. \\n\\n(a) A and B agree to murder Z by severally and at different times giving him small doses of poison. A and B administer the \\npoison according to the agreement with intent to murder Z. Z dies from the effects the several doses of poison so administered to \\nhim. Here A and B intentionally cooperate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is \\ncaused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate. \\n\\n(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours at a time. A and B, \\nintending  to  cause  Z\\'s  death,  knowingly  co-operate  in  causing  that  effect  by  illegally  omitting,  each  during  the  time  of  his \\nattendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose. Z dies of hunger. Both A and B are guilty of the murder of Z. \\n\\n(c)  A,  a  jailor,  has  the  charge  of  Z,  a  prisoner.  A,  intending  to  cause  Z\\'s  death,  illegally  omits  to  supply  Z  with  food;  in \\nconsequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from his \\noffice, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or co-operation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is \\nlikely thereby to cause Z\\'s death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not co-operate with B. A is guilty only of \\nan attempt to commit murder. \\n\\n38. Persons concerned in criminal act may be guilty of different offences.—Where several persons \\nare engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different offences by \\nmeans of that act. \\n\\nA  attacks  Z  under  such  circumstances  of  grave  provocation  that  his  killing  of  Z  would  be  only  culpable  homicide  not \\namounting to murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and intending to kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, assists \\nA in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged in causing Z\\'s death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable \\nhomicide. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\n19 \\n\\n                                                           \\n1.

Accident in doing a lawful act.—Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, \\nand without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful \\nmeans and with proper care and caution. \\n\\nA is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here, if there was no want of proper caution \\n\\non the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence. \\n\\n81.  Act  likely  to  cause  harm,  but  done without  criminal intent,  and  to  prevent  other  harm.—\\nNothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause harm, \\nif it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of preventing \\nor avoiding other harm to person or property. \\n\\nExplanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was \\nof such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that it \\nwas likely to cause harm. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly, and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a position \\nthat, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless  he \\nchanges the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with only two \\npassengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in \\ngood faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run \\ndown the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger \\nwhich he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C. \\n\\n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention \\nin good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so \\nimminent as to excuse A\\'s act, A is not guilty of the offence. \\n\\n82. Act of a child under seven years of age.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under \\n\\nseven years of age.  \\n\\n83.  Act  of  a  child  above  seven  and  under  twelve  of  immature  understanding.—Nothing  is  an \\noffence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under twelve, who has not attained sufficient \\nmaturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion. \\n\\n84. Act of a person of unsound mind.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the \\ntime of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he \\nis doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. \\n\\n85. Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will.—\\nNothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, \\nincapable  of  knowing  the  nature  of  the  act,  or  that  he  is  doing  what  is  either  wrong,  or  contrary  to  \\nlaw;  provided  that  the  thing  which  intoxicated  him  was  administered  to  him  without  his  knowledge  or \\nagainst his will. \\n\\n86. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.—In \\ncases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person who \\ndoes the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge as he \\nwould have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was administered to \\nhim without his knowledge or against his will. \\n\\n87.  Act  not  intended  and  not  known  to  be  likely  to  cause  death  or  grievous  hurt,  done  by \\nconsent.—Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the \\ndoer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, \\nor be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has given consent, \\n\\n \\n\\n25 \\n\\n\\x0cwhether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the \\ndoer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm. \\n\\nA and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which, \\n\\nin the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence. \\n\\n88. Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person\\'s benefit.—Nothing, \\nwhich is not intented to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended \\nby the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is \\ndone in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm, or to take \\nthe risk of that harm. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who suffers under the painful complaint, \\nbut not intending to cause Z\\'s death, and intending, in good faith, Z\\'s benefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z\\'s consent. A has \\ncommitted no offence. \\n\\n89. Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, by or by consent of guardian.—\\nNothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or of unsound \\nmind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of \\nthat person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause or \\nbe known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: Provided— \\n\\nProvisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or to the \\n\\nattempting to cause death; \\n\\nSecondly.—That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing it \\nknows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, \\nor the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\n\\nThirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the \\nattempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or \\nthe curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\n\\nFourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing \\n\\nof which offence it would not extend. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, in good faith, for his child\\'s benefit without his child\\'s consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon knowing it to \\nbe likely that the operation will cause the child\\'s death, but not intending to cause the child\\'s death. A is within the exception,  \\ninasmuch as his object was the cure of the child. \\n\\n90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.—A consent is not such a consent as is \\nintended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a \\nmisconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent was \\ngiven in consequence of such fear or misconception; or \\n\\nConsent of insane person.—if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or \\n\\nintoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or \\n\\nConsent of child.—unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person \\n\\nwho is under twelve years of age. \\n\\n91. Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm cause.—The exceptions in sections \\n87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they may cause, \\nor be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or on whose \\nbehalf the consent is given. \\n\\nCausing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is offence independently of \\nany harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”; and \\nthe consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\n26 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c92. Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.—Nothing is an offence by reason \\nof any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without that \\nperson\\'s consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, or if \\nthat person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of him from \\nwhom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided— \\n\\nProvisos.  First.—That  this  exception  shall  not  extend  to  the  intentional  causing  of  death,  or  the \\n\\nattempting to cause death; \\n\\nSecondly.—That this exception shall not extend  to the doing of anything which the person doing it \\nknows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or \\nthe curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\n\\nThirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to \\n\\ncause hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt; \\n\\nFourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing of \\n\\nwhich offence it would not extend. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be trepanned. A, not intending Z\\'s death, \\nbut in good faith, for Z\\'s benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed no \\noffence. \\n\\n(b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill Z, but not intending to kill Z, \\n\\nand in good faith intending Z\\'s benefit. A\\'s ball gives Z a mortal wound. A has committed no offence. \\n\\n(c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an operation be immediately performed. \\nThere is not time to apply to the child\\'s guardian. A performs the operation in spite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in good \\nfaith, the child\\'s benefit. A has committed no offence. \\n\\n(d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A drops the child from the house stop, \\nknowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child\\'s \\nbenefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence. \\n\\nExplanation.—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 88, 89 and 92. \\n\\n93. Communication made in good faith.—No communication made in good faith is an offence by \\n\\nreason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live. The patient dies in consequence of the \\n\\nshock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient\\'s death. \\n\\n94. Act to which a person is compelled by threats.—Except murder, and offences against the State \\npunishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, \\nwhich,  at  the  time  of  doing  it,  reasonably  cause  the  apprehension  that  instant  death  to  that  person  will \\notherwise  be  the  consequence:  Provided  the  person  doing  the  act  did  not  of  his  own  accord,  or  from  a \\nreasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which \\nhe became subject to such constraint. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins a gang \\nof dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the ground of his \\nhaving been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant death, to do a \\nthing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of \\na house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception. \\n\\n95. Act causing slight harm.—Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to \\ncause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of ordinary \\nsense and temper would complain of such harm. \\n\\n96. Things done in private defence.—Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right \\n\\n \\nOf the Right of Private Defence \\n\\n27 \\n\\nof private defence. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c97. Right of private defence of the body and of property.—Every person has a right, subject to the \\n\\nrestrictions contained in section 99, to defend— \\n\\nFirst.—His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human body; \\n\\nSecondly.—The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against \\nany act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or \\nwhich is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass. \\n\\n98. Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc.—When an act, which \\nwould otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of maturity of \\nunderstanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by reason of any \\nmisconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence against that act \\nwhich he would have if the act were that offence. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. But A has the same right of private defence \\n\\nwhich he would have if Z were sane. \\n\\n(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A. \\nHere Z, by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z, which \\nhe would have if Z were not acting under that misconception. \\n\\n99. Acts against which there is no right of private defence.—There is no right of private defence \\nagainst an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or \\nattempted to be done, by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that act, \\nmay not be strictly justifiable by law. \\n\\nThere is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension \\nof death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant acting in \\ngood faith under colour of his office, though that direction may not be strictly justifiable by law. \\n\\nThere is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to protection of the \\n\\npublic authorities. \\n\\nExtent to which the right may be exercised.—The right of private defence in no case extends to the \\n\\ninflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence. \\n\\nExplanation  1.—A  person  is  not  deprived  of  the  right  of  private  defence  against  an  act  done,  or \\nattempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows or has reason to believe, that the person \\ndoing the act is such public servant. \\n\\nExplanation  2.—A  person  is  not  deprived  of  the  right  of  private  defence  against  an  act  done,  or \\nattempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that \\nthe person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such person states the authority under which \\nhe acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded. \\n\\n100. When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death.—The right of private \\ndefence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section, to the voluntary \\ncausing of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the offence which occasions the exercise of the \\nright be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:— \\n\\nFirst.—Such  an  assault  as  may  reasonably  cause  the  apprehension  that  death  will  otherwise  be  the \\n\\nconsequence of such assault; \\n\\nbe the consequence of such assault; \\n\\nSecondly.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise \\n\\nThirdly.—An assault with the intention of committing rape; \\n\\nFourthly.—An assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust; \\n\\nFifthly.—An assault with the intention of kidnapping or abducting; \\n\\nSixthly.—An assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under circumstances which \\nmay reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the public authorities for \\nhis release. \\n\\n \\n\\n28 \\n\\n\\x0cSeventhly.—An act of throwing or administering acid or an attempt to throw or administer acid which \\nmay reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such act. \\n\\n101. When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.—If the offence be not of any \\nof the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, the right of private defence of the body does \\nnot  extend  to  the  voluntary  causing  of  death  to  the  assailant,  but  does  extend,  under  the  restrictions \\nmentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death. \\n\\n102. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body.—The right of \\nprivate defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises \\nfrom an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed; and it \\ncontinues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues. \\n\\n103. When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death.—The right of private \\ndefence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the  voluntary causing of \\ndeath or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to \\ncommit  which,  occasions  the  exercise  of  the  right,  be  an  offence  of  any  of  the  descriptions  hereinafter \\nenumerated, namely:— \\n\\nFirst.—Robbery; \\n\\nSecondly.—House-breaking by night; \\n\\nThirdly.—Mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is \\n\\nused as a human dwelling, or as a place for the custody of property; \\n\\nFourthly.—Theft,  mischief,  or  house-trespass,  under  such  circumstances  as  may  reasonably  cause \\napprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of private defence is not \\nexercised. \\n\\nSTATE AMENDMENTS \\n\\nKarnataka \\n\\n(1) In section 103, in clause Thirdly, — \\n\\n(i) after the words “mischief by fire”, the words “or any explosive substance” Shall be inserted; \\n\\n(ii) after the words “as a human dwelling, or”the words “as a place of worship, or” shall be inserted. \\n\\n(2) After clause Fourthly, the following clause shall be inserted namely:— \\n\\n“Fifthly.— Mischief by fire or any explosive substance committed on any property used or intended to \\nbe  used  for  the  purpose  of  Government  or  any  local  authority,  statutory  body  or  company  owned  or \\ncontrolled by Government or railway or any vehicle used or adapted to be used for the carriage of passengers \\nfor hire or reward”. \\n\\n[Vide Karnataka Act 8 of 1972, sec. 2]. \\n\\n104.  When  such  right  extends  to  causing  any  harm  other  than  death.—If  the  offence,  the \\ncommitting  of  which,  or  the  attempting  to  commit  which  occasions  the  exercise  of  the  right  of  private \\ndefence,  be  theft,  mischief,  or  criminal  trespass,  not  of  any  of  the  descriptions  enumerated  in  the  last \\npreceding section, that right does not extend to the voluntary causing of death, but does extend, subject to \\nthe restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the wrong-doer of any harm other than \\ndeath. \\n\\n105. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of property.—The right of \\nprivate  defence  of  property  commences  when  a  reasonable  apprehension  of  danger  to  the  property \\ncommences. \\n\\nThe right of private defence of property against theft continues till the offender has effected his retreat \\nwith  the  property  or  either  the  assistance  of the public  authorities is  obtained,  or  the property  has  been \\nrecovered. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Ins. by Act 13 of 2013, s. 2 (w.e.f. 3-2-2013). \\n\\n29 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cThe right of private defence of property against robbery continues as long as the offender causes or \\nattempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or as long as the fear of instant death or \\nof instant hurt or of instant personal restraint continues. \\n\\nThe right of private defence of property against criminal trespass or mischief continues as long as the \\n\\noffender continues in the commission of criminal trespass or mischief. \\n\\nThe right of private defence of property against house-breaking by night continues as long as the house-\\n\\ntrespass which has been begun by such house-breaking continues. \\n\\n106.  Right  of  private  defence  against  deadly  assault  when  there  is  risk  of  harm  to  innocent \\nperson.—If in the exercise of the right of private defence against an assault which reasonably causes the \\napprehension of death, the defender be so situated that he cannot effectually exercise that right without risk \\nof harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of that risk. \\n\\nA is attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his right of private defence without firing \\non the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children who are mingled with the mob. A commits no offence if by \\nso firing he harms any of the children. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nCHAPTER V \\n\\nOF ABETMENT \\n\\n107. Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the doing of a thing, who— \\n\\nFirst.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or \\n\\nSecondly.—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that \\nthing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of \\nthat thing; or \\n\\nThirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material \\nfact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing \\nto be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z, B, knowing that fact and also that C is \\nnot Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the \\napprehension of C. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in \\norder to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid \\nthe doing of that act. \\n\\n108.  Abettor.—A  person  abets  an  offence,  who  abets  either  the  commission  of  an  offence,  or  the \\ncommission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing \\nan offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence although the \\n\\nabettor may not himself be bound to do that act. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should be \\n\\ncommitted, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of instigating \\n\\nB to commit murder. \\n\\nExplanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an \\noffence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty \\nintention or knowledge. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n30 \\n\\n\\x0cIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person \\ncapable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is \\nguilty of abetting an offence. \\n\\n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z\\'s death. \\nB, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z\\'s death. Here, though B was not capable \\nby law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an \\noffence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. \\n\\n(c)  A  instigates  B  to  set  fire  to  a  dwelling-house.  B,  in  consequence  of  the  unsoundness  of  his  mind,  being  incapable  of \\nknowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A\\'s \\ninstigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to \\nthe punishment provided for that offence. \\n\\n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession. A induces \\nB to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z\\'s possession, in good faith, believing it to be A\\'s property. \\nB, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, \\nand is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. \\n\\nExplanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also \\n\\nan offence. \\n\\nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence \\nof B\\'s instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the \\noffence, A is also liable to the same punishment. \\n\\nExplanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that \\nthe abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the \\nconspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. \\n\\nA  concerts  with  B  a  plan  for  poisoning  Z.  It  is  agreed  that  A  shall  administer  the  poison.  B  then  explains  the  plan  to  C \\nmentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A\\'s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and \\nprocures  and  delivers  it  to  B  for  the  purpose  of  its  being  used  in  the  manner  explained.  A  administers  the  poison;  Z  dies  in \\nconsequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which \\nZ has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder. \\n\\n108A. Abetment in India of offences outside India.—A person abets an offence within the meaning \\nof this Code who, in India, abets the commission of any act without and beyond  India which would \\nconstitute an offence if committed in India. \\n\\nA, in India, instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa, A is guilty of abetting murder.] \\n\\n109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express \\nprovision is made for its punishment.—Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed \\nin consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such \\nabetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. \\n\\nExplanation.—An  act  or  offence  is  said  to  be  committed  in  consequence  of  abetment,  when  it  is \\ncommitted  in  consequence  of  the  instigation,  or  in  pursuance  of  the  conspiracy,  or  with  the  aid  which \\nconstitutes the abetment. \\n\\n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the exercise of B\\'s official functions. B \\n\\naccepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined in section 161. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Added by Act 4 of 1898, s. 3. \\n2. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A.O. 1948, the A.O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch., to \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n31 \\n\\nread as above. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting \\n\\nthat offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B. \\n\\n(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he \\nmay administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A’s absence and thereby causes Z’s death. \\nHere B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder. \\n\\n110.  Punishment  of  abetment  if  person  abetted  does  act  with  different  intention  from  that  of \\nabettor.—Whoever  abets the  commission of  an  offence  shall,  if the  person  abetted  does  the  act  with  a \\ndifferent intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for the \\noffence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge of the \\nabettor and with no other. \\n\\n111. Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done.—When an Act is abetted and \\na different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent as if \\nhe had directly abetted it: \\n\\nProvided  the  act  done  was  a  probable  consequence  of  the  abetment,  and  was  committed  under  the \\ninfluence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the abetment. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. The \\nchild, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y, which is by the side \\nof that of Z. Here, if the child was acting under the influence of A\\'s instigation, and the act done was under \\nthe circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable in the same manner and to the same \\nextent as if he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to burn Z’s house B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of \\nproperty there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for \\nthe theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning. \\n\\n(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and \\nprovides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the \\ninmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the \\npunishment provided for murder. \\n\\n112. Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done.—If the act \\nfor which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committed in addition to the act abetted, \\nand constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences. \\n\\nA instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence, resists that distress. In offering the \\nresistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the distress. As B has committed both the offence of resisting \\nthe distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and, if A knew \\nthat B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each of the \\noffences. \\n\\n113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different from that intended by \\nthe abettor.—When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular \\neffect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a different effect \\nfrom that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in the same manner and to the \\nsame extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the \\nact abetted was likely to cause that effect. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA  instigates  B  to  cause  grievous  hurt  to  Z.  B,  in  consequence  of  the  instigation,  causes  grievous  hurt  to  Z.  Z  dies  in \\nconsequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the punishment \\nprovided for murder. \\n\\n114. Abettor present when offence is committed.—Whenever any person, who is absent would be \\nliable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in \\nconsequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence. \\n\\n \\n\\n32 \\n\\n\\x0c115.  Abetment  of  offence  punishable  with  death  or  imprisonment  for  life.—if  offence  not \\ncommitted.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for \\nlife, shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is \\nmade  by  this  Code  for  the  punishment  of  such  abetment,  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either \\ndescription for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine; \\n\\nif  act  causing  harm  be  done  in  consequence.—and  if  any  act  for  which  the  abettor  is  liable  in \\nconsequence of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable to \\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be liable \\nto fine. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA instigates B to murder Z. The offence is not committed. If B had murdered Z, he would have been subject to the punishment \\nof death or imprisonment for life. Therefore A is liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and also to \\na fine; and if any hurt be done to Z in consequence of the abetment, he will be liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend \\nto fourteen years, and to fine. \\n\\n116. Abetment of offence punishable with imprisonment—if offence be not committed.—Whoever \\nabets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of \\nthe  abetment,  and  no  express  provision  is  made  by  this  Code  for  the  punishment  of  such  abetment,  be \\npunished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence for a term which may extend to \\none-fourth  part  of  the  longest  term  provided  for  that  offence;  or  with  such  fine  as  is  provided  for  that \\noffence, or with both; \\n\\nif abettor or person abetted be a public servant whose duty it is to prevent offence.—and if the \\nabettor or the person abetted is a public servant, whose duty it is to prevent the commission of such offence, \\nthe abettor shall be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence, for a term \\nwhich may extend to one-half of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such fine as is provided \\nfor the offence, or with both. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing. A somefavour in the exercise of B’s official functions. B \\n\\nrefuses to accept the bribe. A is punishable under this section. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. Here, if B does not give false evidence, A has nevertheless committed the offence \\n\\ndefined in this section, and is punishable accordingly. \\n\\n(c) A, a police-officer, whose duty it is to prevent robbery, abets the commission of robbery. Here, though the robbery be not \\n\\ncommitted, A is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for that offence, and also to fine. \\n\\n(d) B abets the commission of a robbery by A, a police-officer, whose duty it is to prevent that offence. Here, though the \\nrobbery be not committed, B is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for the offence of robbery, and also \\nto fine. \\n\\n117. Abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than ten persons.—Whoever abets \\nthe commission of an offence by the public generally or by any number or class of persons exceeding ten, \\nshall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or \\nwith fine, or with both. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA affixes in a public place a placard instigating a sect consisting of more than ten members to meet at a certain time and place, \\nfor the purpose of attacking the members of an adverse sect, while engaged in a procession.

A has given false evidence. \\n\\n(b) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of Z, when he \\n\\ndoes not believe it to be the handwriting of Z. Here A states that which he knows to be false, and therefore gives false evidence. \\n\\n(c) A, knowing the general character of Z\\'s handwriting, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of Z; \\nA in good faith believing it to be so. Here A\\'s statement is merely as to his belief, and is true as to his belief, and therefore, although \\nthe signature may not be the handwriting of Z, A has not given false evidence. \\n\\n(d) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he knows that Z was at a particular place on a particular day, not \\n\\nknowing anything upon the subject. A gives false evidence whether Z was at that place on the day named or not. \\n\\n(e) A, an interpreter or translator, gives or certifies as a true interpretation or translation of a statement or document which he \\nis  bound  by  oath  to  interpret  or  translate  truly,  that  which  is  not  and  which  he  does  not  believe  to  be  a  true  interpretation  or \\ntranslation.

A has fabricated false evidence. \\n\\n(b) A makes a false entry in his shop-book for the purpose of using it as corroborative evidence in a Court of Justice. A has \\n\\nfabricated false evidence. \\n\\n(c) A, with the intention of causing Z to be convicted of a criminal conspiracy, writes a letter in imitation of Z\\'s handwriting, \\npurporting to be addressed to an accomplice in such criminal conspiracy, and puts the letter in a place which he knows that the \\nofficers of the police are likely to search. A has fabricated false evidence. \\n\\n193.

Culpable homicide.—Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, \\nor with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he \\nis likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide. \\n\\n(a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to \\nbe thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable \\nhomicide. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Ins. by Act 25 of 1927, s. 2. \\n2. Subs. by the A. O. 1950, for “His Majesty’s subjects”. \\n3. Subs. by Act 41 of 1961, s. 3, for certain words. \\n4. Subs. by s. 3, ibid., for “two years”. \\n\\n \\n\\n72 \\n\\n\\x0c(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z\\'s death, \\ninduces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable \\nhomicide. \\n\\n(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. Here, \\nalthough A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause death by \\ndoing an act that he knew was likely to cause death. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, disease \\nor bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused his death. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury shall \\nbe deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment the \\ndeath might have been prevented. \\n\\nExplanation 3.—The causing of the death of a child in the mother\\'s womb is not homicide. But it may \\namount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought \\nforth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born. \\n\\n300. Murder.—Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by \\n\\nwhich the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or— \\n\\n2ndly.—If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely \\n\\nto cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or— \\n\\n3rdly.—If  it  is  done  with the  intention  of  causing  bodily  injury  to  any  person  and  the  bodily  injury \\n\\nintended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or— \\n\\n4thly.—If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all \\nprobability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any \\nexcuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. \\n\\n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention \\nof causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient \\nin the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring \\nunder any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here \\nA, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury \\nas in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. \\n\\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. \\n\\nZ dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z\\'s death. \\n\\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although \\n\\nhe may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. \\n\\nException  1.—When  culpable  homicide  is  not  murder.—Culpable  homicide  is  not  murder  if  the \\noffender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death \\nof the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. \\n\\nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos:— \\n\\nFirst.—That the  provocation  is  not  sought  or  voluntarily  provoked  by  the offender as an  excuse for \\n\\nkilling or doing harm to any person. \\n\\nSecondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public \\n\\nservant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. \\n\\nThirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private \\n\\ndefence. \\n\\n \\n\\n73 \\n\\n\\x0cExplanation.—Whether  the  provocation  was  grave  and  sudden  enough  to  prevent  the  offence  from \\n\\namounting to murder is a question of fact. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z\\'s child. This is murder, \\ninasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in \\ndoing an act caused by the provocation. \\n\\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing \\nhimself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable \\nhomicide. \\n\\n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, \\n\\ninasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. \\n\\n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A\\'s deposition, and that A has \\n\\nperjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. \\n\\n(e)A attempts to pull Z\\'s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. \\nA is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by \\na thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. \\n\\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B\\'s rage, and to \\ncause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B\\'s hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable \\nhomicide, but A is guilty of murder. \\n\\nException 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the right \\nof private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of \\nthe person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any \\nintention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. \\nA  believing  in  good  faith  that  he  can  by  no  other  means  prevent  himself  from  being  horsewhipped,  shoots  Z  dead.  A  has  not \\ncommitted murder, but only culpable homicide. \\n\\nException 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public \\nservant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes \\ndeath by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of \\nhis duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused. \\n\\nException 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden \\nfight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender\\'s having taken undue advantage \\nor acted in a cruel or unusual manner. \\n\\nExplanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first \\n\\nassault. \\n\\nException 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above \\n\\nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z\\'s youth, \\n\\nhe was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder. \\n\\n301.  Culpable  homicide  by  causing  death  of  person  other  than  person  whose  death  was \\nintended.—If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, commits \\nculpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither intends nor knows himself \\nto be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of which it \\nwould have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or knew himself to he \\nlikely to cause. \\n\\n \\n\\n74 \\n\\n\\x0c302.  Punishment  for  murder.—Whoever  commits  murder  shall  be  punished  with  death  or \\n\\nimprisonment for life,  and shall also be liable to fine. \\n\\n303. Punishment for murder by life-convict.—Whoever, being under sentence of imprisonment for \\n\\nlife, commits murder, shall be punished with death. \\n\\n304. Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.—Whoever commits culpable \\nhomicide not amounting to murder, shall be punished with  imprisonment for life, or imprisonment of \\neither description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by \\nwhich the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is \\nlikely to cause death; \\n\\nor with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or \\nwith both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to \\ncause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. \\n\\n304A. Causing death by negligence.—Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash \\nor  negligent  act  not  amounting  to  culpable  homicide,  shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either \\ndescription for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. \\n\\nHimachal Pradesh.— \\n\\nSTATE AMENDMENTS \\n\\nAfter Section 304 A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860,  in its application to the State of Himachal \\n\\nPradesh, the following section shall be added, namely: — \\n\\n“304-AA.

A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the \\nstream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is \\nproduced without any other action on any person\\'s part. A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without \\nZ\\'s consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will cause injury, \\nfear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z\\'s horses, and thereby causes them to quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of \\nmotion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z\\'s \\nconsent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of \\nmotion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, \\nwithout Z\\'s consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his own person so as to bring it \\ninto contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z\\'s consent, intending or knowing \\nit to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z\\'s \\nclothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z\\'s clothes or something carried \\nby Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z\\'s clothes, A \\nhas used force to Z, and if he did so without Z\\'s consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force \\nto Z. \\n\\n(f) A intentionally pulls up a Woman\\'s veil. Here  A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does so without her consent \\n\\nintending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her. \\n\\n(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by his own bodily power \\ncauses such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact \\nmust affect Z\\'s sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without Z\\'s consent intending \\nor knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force. \\n\\n(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z\\'s consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses \\n\\ncriminal force to Z. \\n\\n \\n\\n82 \\n\\n\\x0c351.

But the words which a person uses may give \\nto his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an \\nassault. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike \\n\\nZ. A has committed an assault. \\n\\n(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to \\n\\nbelieve that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A has committed an assault upon Z. \\n\\n(c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, “I will give you a beating”. Here, though the words used by A could in no case amount to \\nan assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault,the gesture \\nexplained by the words may amount to an assault. \\n\\n352.

Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention.—When a criminal act is \\ndone by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for \\nthat act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone. \\n\\n35.

A and B administer the \\npoison according to the agreement with intent to murder Z. Z dies from the effects the several doses of poison so administered to \\nhim. Here A and B intentionally cooperate in the commission of murder and as each of them does an act by which the death is \\ncaused, they are both guilty of the offence though their acts are separate. \\n\\n(b) A and B are joint jailors, and as such have the charge of Z, a prisoner, alternatively for six hours at a time. A and B, \\nintending  to  cause  Z\\'s  death,  knowingly  co-operate  in  causing  that  effect  by  illegally  omitting,  each  during  the  time  of  his \\nattendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose.

A,  intending  to  cause  Z\\'s  death,  illegally  omits  to  supply  Z  with  food;  in \\nconsequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from his \\noffice, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or co-operation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is \\nlikely thereby to cause Z\\'s death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not co-operate with B. A is guilty only of \\nan attempt to commit murder. \\n\\n38. Persons concerned in criminal act may be guilty of different offences.—Where several persons \\nare engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different offences by \\nmeans of that act. \\n\\nA  attacks  Z  under  such  circumstances  of  grave  provocation  that  his  killing  of  Z  would  be  only  culpable  homicide  not \\namounting to murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and intending to kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, assists \\nA in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged in causing Z\\'s death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable \\nhomicide. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\n19 \\n\\n                                                           \\n1.

Here, if seventy-five \\nrupees of the fine be paid or levied before the expiration of one month of the imprisonment, A will be discharged as soon as the \\nfirst month has expired. If seventy-five rupees be paid or levied at the time of the expiration of the first month, or at any later time \\nwhile  A  continues  in  imprisonment,  A  will  be  immediately  discharged.  If  fifty  rupees  of  the  fine  be  paid or  levied  before  the \\nexpiration of two months of the imprisonment. A will be discharged as soon as the two months are completed.

Limit  of  punishment  of  offence  made  up  of  several  offences.—Where  anything  which  is  an \\noffence is made up of parts, any of which parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished with \\nthe punishment of more than one of such his offences, unless it be so expressly provided. \\n\\nWhere anything is an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law in force for \\n\\nthe time being by which offences are defined or punished, or \\n\\nwhere several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves constitute an offence, \\n\\nconstitute, when combined, a different offence, \\n\\nthe offender shall not be punished with a more severe punishment than the Court which tries him could \\n\\naward for any one of such offences. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A gives Z fifty strokes with a stick. Here A may have committed the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to Z by the whole \\nbeating, and also by each of the blows which make up the whole beating. If A were liable to punishment for every blow, he might \\nbe imprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow. But he is liable only to one punishment for the whole beating. \\n\\n(b) But, if, while A is beating Z, Y interferes, and A intentionally strikes Y, here, as the blow given to Y is no part of the act \\nwhereby A voluntarily causes hurt to Z, A is liable to one punishment for voluntarily causing hurt to Z, and to another for the blow \\ngiven to Y. \\n\\n72. Punishment of person guilty of one of several offences, the judgment stating that it is doubtful \\nof  which.—In  all  cases  in  which  judgment  is  given  that  a  person  is  guilty  of  one  of  several  offences \\nspecified in the judgment, but that it is doubtful of which of these offences he is guilty, the offender shall \\nbe punished for the offence for which the lowest punishment is provided if the same punishment is not \\nprovided for all. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Ins. by Act 8 of 1882, s. 3. \\n2. Added by s. 4, ibid. \\n\\n \\n\\n23 \\n\\n\\x0c73. Solitary confinement.—Whenever any person is convicted of an offence for which under this Code \\nthe Court has power to sentence him to rigorous imprisonment, the Court may, by its sentence, order that \\nthe offender shall be kept in solitary confinement for any portion or portions of the imprisonment to which \\nhe is sentenced, not exceeding three months in the whole, according to the following scale, that is to say— \\n\\na time not exceeding one month if the term of imprisonment shall not exceed six months; \\n\\na time not exceeding two months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed six months andshall not \\n\\nexceed one year \\n\\na time not exceeding three months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed one year. \\n\\n74.

Act done by a person bound, or by mistake of fact believing himself bound, by law.—Nothing \\nis an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of \\na mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be, bound by law to do it. \\n\\n(a)  A,  a  soldier,  fires  on  a  mob by  the  order  of  his  superior  officer,  in  conformity  with  the  commands  of  the  law.  A  has \\n\\ncommitted no offence. \\n\\narrests Z. A has committed no offence. \\n\\n(b) A, an officer of a Court of Justice, being ordered by that Court to arrest Y, and after due enquiry, believing Z to be Y, \\n\\n77.  Act  of  Judge when  acting judicially.—Nothing  is  an offence  which  is  done  by  a  Judge  when \\nacting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which in good faith he believes to be, given to \\nhim by law. \\n\\n78. Act done pursuant to the judgment or order of Court.—Nothing which is done in pursuance of, \\nor which is warranted by the judgment or order of, a Court of Justice; if done whilst such judgment or order \\nremains  in  force,  is  an  offence,  notwithstanding  the  Court  may  have  had  no  jurisdiction  to  pass  such \\njudgment  or  order,  provided  the  person  doing  the  act  in  good  faith  believes  that  the  Court  had  such \\njurisdiction. \\n\\n79. Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself, justified, by law.—\\nNothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Subs. by Act 8 of 1862, s. 5, for “be less than a”. \\n2. Subs. by Act 3 of 1910, s. 2, for section 75. \\n3. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A. O. 1948, the A. O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch., \\n\\nto read as above. \\n\\n4. The word “or” omitted by Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch. \\n5. Cl. (b) omitted by s. 3 and the Sch., ibid. \\n6. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). \\n\\n \\n\\n24 \\n\\n\\x0cof fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith, believes himself to be justified by law, in doing \\nit. \\n\\nA sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, of the \\npower which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in the fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper \\nauthorities. A has committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in self-defence. \\n\\n80. Accident in doing a lawful act.—Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, \\nand without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful \\nmeans and with proper care and caution. \\n\\nA is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here, if there was no want of proper caution \\n\\non the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence. \\n\\n81.  Act  likely  to  cause  harm,  but  done without  criminal intent,  and  to  prevent  other  harm.—\\nNothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause harm, \\nif it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of preventing \\nor avoiding other harm to person or property. \\n\\nExplanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was \\nof such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that it \\nwas likely to cause harm. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly, and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a position \\nthat, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless  he \\nchanges the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with only two \\npassengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in \\ngood faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run \\ndown the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger \\nwhich he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C. \\n\\n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention \\nin good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so \\nimminent as to excuse A\\'s act, A is not guilty of the offence. \\n\\n82. Act of a child under seven years of age.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under \\n\\nseven years of age.  \\n\\n83.  Act  of  a  child  above  seven  and  under  twelve  of  immature  understanding.—Nothing  is  an \\noffence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under twelve, who has not attained sufficient \\nmaturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion. \\n\\n84. Act of a person of unsound mind.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the \\ntime of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he \\nis doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. \\n\\n85. Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will.—\\nNothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, \\nincapable  of  knowing  the  nature  of  the  act,  or  that  he  is  doing  what  is  either  wrong,  or  contrary  to  \\nlaw;  provided  that  the  thing  which  intoxicated  him  was  administered  to  him  without  his  knowledge  or \\nagainst his will. \\n\\n86. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.—In \\ncases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person who \\ndoes the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge as he \\nwould have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was administered to \\nhim without his knowledge or against his will. \\n\\n87.  Act  not  intended  and  not  known  to  be  likely  to  cause  death  or  grievous  hurt,  done  by \\nconsent.—Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the \\ndoer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, \\nor be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has given consent, \\n\\n \\n\\n25 \\n\\n\\x0cwhether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the \\ndoer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm. \\n\\nA and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which, \\n\\nin the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence. \\n\\n88. Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person\\'s benefit.—Nothing, \\nwhich is not intented to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended \\nby the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is \\ndone in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm, or to take \\nthe risk of that harm. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who suffers under the painful complaint, \\nbut not intending to cause Z\\'s death, and intending, in good faith, Z\\'s benefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z\\'s consent. A has \\ncommitted no offence. \\n\\n89. Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, by or by consent of guardian.—\\nNothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or of unsound \\nmind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of \\nthat person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause or \\nbe known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: Provided— \\n\\nProvisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or to the \\n\\nattempting to cause death; \\n\\nSecondly.—That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing it \\nknows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, \\nor the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\n\\nThirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the \\nattempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or \\nthe curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\n\\nFourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing \\n\\nof which offence it would not extend. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, in good faith, for his child\\'s benefit without his child\\'s consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon knowing it to \\nbe likely that the operation will cause the child\\'s death, but not intending to cause the child\\'s death. A is within the exception,  \\ninasmuch as his object was the cure of the child. \\n\\n90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.—A consent is not such a consent as is \\nintended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a \\nmisconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent was \\ngiven in consequence of such fear or misconception; or \\n\\nConsent of insane person.—if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or \\n\\nintoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or \\n\\nConsent of child.—unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person \\n\\nwho is under twelve years of age. \\n\\n91. Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm cause.—The exceptions in sections \\n87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they may cause, \\nor be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or on whose \\nbehalf the consent is given. \\n\\nCausing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is offence independently of \\nany harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”; and \\nthe consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\n26 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c92. Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.—Nothing is an offence by reason \\nof any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without that \\nperson\\'s consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, or if \\nthat person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of him from \\nwhom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided— \\n\\nProvisos.  First.—That  this  exception  shall  not  extend  to  the  intentional  causing  of  death,  or  the \\n\\nattempting to cause death; \\n\\nSecondly.—That this exception shall not extend  to the doing of anything which the person doing it \\nknows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or \\nthe curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\n\\nThirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to \\n\\ncause hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt; \\n\\nFourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing of \\n\\nwhich offence it would not extend. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be trepanned. A, not intending Z\\'s death, \\nbut in good faith, for Z\\'s benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed no \\noffence. \\n\\n(b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill Z, but not intending to kill Z, \\n\\nand in good faith intending Z\\'s benefit. A\\'s ball gives Z a mortal wound. A has committed no offence. \\n\\n(c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an operation be immediately performed. \\nThere is not time to apply to the child\\'s guardian. A performs the operation in spite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in good \\nfaith, the child\\'s benefit. A has committed no offence. \\n\\n(d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A drops the child from the house stop, \\nknowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child\\'s \\nbenefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence. \\n\\nExplanation.—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 88, 89 and 92. \\n\\n93. Communication made in good faith.—No communication made in good faith is an offence by \\n\\nreason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live. The patient dies in consequence of the \\n\\nshock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient\\'s death. \\n\\n94. Act to which a person is compelled by threats.—Except murder, and offences against the State \\npunishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, \\nwhich,  at  the  time  of  doing  it,  reasonably  cause  the  apprehension  that  instant  death  to  that  person  will \\notherwise  be  the  consequence:  Provided  the  person  doing  the  act  did  not  of  his  own  accord,  or  from  a \\nreasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which \\nhe became subject to such constraint. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins a gang \\nof dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the ground of his \\nhaving been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant death, to do a \\nthing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of \\na house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception. \\n\\n95. Act causing slight harm.—Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to \\ncause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of ordinary \\nsense and temper would complain of such harm. \\n\\n96. Things done in private defence.—Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right \\n\\n \\nOf the Right of Private Defence \\n\\n27 \\n\\nof private defence. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c97. Right of private defence of the body and of property.—Every person has a right, subject to the \\n\\nrestrictions contained in section 99, to defend— \\n\\nFirst.—His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human body; \\n\\nSecondly.—The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against \\nany act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or \\nwhich is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass. \\n\\n98. Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc.—When an act, which \\nwould otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of maturity of \\nunderstanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by reason of any \\nmisconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence against that act \\nwhich he would have if the act were that offence. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. But A has the same right of private defence \\n\\nwhich he would have if Z were sane. \\n\\n(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A. \\nHere Z, by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z, which \\nhe would have if Z were not acting under that misconception. \\n\\n99. Acts against which there is no right of private defence.—There is no right of private defence \\nagainst an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or \\nattempted to be done, by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that act, \\nmay not be strictly justifiable by law. \\n\\nThere is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension \\nof death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant acting in \\ngood faith under colour of his office, though that direction may not be strictly justifiable by law. \\n\\nThere is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to protection of the \\n\\npublic authorities. \\n\\nExtent to which the right may be exercised.—The right of private defence in no case extends to the \\n\\ninflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence. \\n\\nExplanation  1.—A  person  is  not  deprived  of  the  right  of  private  defence  against  an  act  done,  or \\nattempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows or has reason to believe, that the person \\ndoing the act is such public servant. \\n\\nExplanation  2.—A  person  is  not  deprived  of  the  right  of  private  defence  against  an  act  done,  or \\nattempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that \\nthe person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such person states the authority under which \\nhe acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded. \\n\\n100. When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death.—The right of private \\ndefence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section, to the voluntary \\ncausing of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the offence which occasions the exercise of the \\nright be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:— \\n\\nFirst.—Such  an  assault  as  may  reasonably  cause  the  apprehension  that  death  will  otherwise  be  the \\n\\nconsequence of such assault; \\n\\nbe the consequence of such assault; \\n\\nSecondly.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise \\n\\nThirdly.—An assault with the intention of committing rape; \\n\\nFourthly.—An assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust; \\n\\nFifthly.—An assault with the intention of kidnapping or abducting; \\n\\nSixthly.—An assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under circumstances which \\nmay reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the public authorities for \\nhis release. \\n\\n \\n\\n28 \\n\\n\\x0cSeventhly.—An act of throwing or administering acid or an attempt to throw or administer acid which \\nmay reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such act. \\n\\n101. When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.—If the offence be not of any \\nof the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, the right of private defence of the body does \\nnot  extend  to  the  voluntary  causing  of  death  to  the  assailant,  but  does  extend,  under  the  restrictions \\nmentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death. \\n\\n102. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body.—The right of \\nprivate defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises \\nfrom an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed; and it \\ncontinues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues. \\n\\n103. When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death.—The right of private \\ndefence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the  voluntary causing of \\ndeath or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to \\ncommit  which,  occasions  the  exercise  of  the  right,  be  an  offence  of  any  of  the  descriptions  hereinafter \\nenumerated, namely:— \\n\\nFirst.—Robbery; \\n\\nSecondly.—House-breaking by night; \\n\\nThirdly.—Mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is \\n\\nused as a human dwelling, or as a place for the custody of property; \\n\\nFourthly.—Theft,  mischief,  or  house-trespass,  under  such  circumstances  as  may  reasonably  cause \\napprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of private defence is not \\nexercised. \\n\\nSTATE AMENDMENTS \\n\\nKarnataka \\n\\n(1) In section 103, in clause Thirdly, — \\n\\n(i) after the words “mischief by fire”, the words “or any explosive substance” Shall be inserted; \\n\\n(ii) after the words “as a human dwelling, or”the words “as a place of worship, or” shall be inserted. \\n\\n(2) After clause Fourthly, the following clause shall be inserted namely:— \\n\\n“Fifthly.— Mischief by fire or any explosive substance committed on any property used or intended to \\nbe  used  for  the  purpose  of  Government  or  any  local  authority,  statutory  body  or  company  owned  or \\ncontrolled by Government or railway or any vehicle used or adapted to be used for the carriage of passengers \\nfor hire or reward”. \\n\\n[Vide Karnataka Act 8 of 1972, sec. 2]. \\n\\n104.  When  such  right  extends  to  causing  any  harm  other  than  death.—If  the  offence,  the \\ncommitting  of  which,  or  the  attempting  to  commit  which  occasions  the  exercise  of  the  right  of  private \\ndefence,  be  theft,  mischief,  or  criminal  trespass,  not  of  any  of  the  descriptions  enumerated  in  the  last \\npreceding section, that right does not extend to the voluntary causing of death, but does extend, subject to \\nthe restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the wrong-doer of any harm other than \\ndeath. \\n\\n105. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of property.—The right of \\nprivate  defence  of  property  commences  when  a  reasonable  apprehension  of  danger  to  the  property \\ncommences. \\n\\nThe right of private defence of property against theft continues till the offender has effected his retreat \\nwith  the  property  or  either  the  assistance  of the public  authorities is  obtained,  or  the property  has  been \\nrecovered. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Ins. by Act 13 of 2013, s. 2 (w.e.f. 3-2-2013). \\n\\n29 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cThe right of private defence of property against robbery continues as long as the offender causes or \\nattempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or as long as the fear of instant death or \\nof instant hurt or of instant personal restraint continues. \\n\\nThe right of private defence of property against criminal trespass or mischief continues as long as the \\n\\noffender continues in the commission of criminal trespass or mischief. \\n\\nThe right of private defence of property against house-breaking by night continues as long as the house-\\n\\ntrespass which has been begun by such house-breaking continues. \\n\\n106.  Right  of  private  defence  against  deadly  assault  when  there  is  risk  of  harm  to  innocent \\nperson.—If in the exercise of the right of private defence against an assault which reasonably causes the \\napprehension of death, the defender be so situated that he cannot effectually exercise that right without risk \\nof harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of that risk. \\n\\nA is attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his right of private defence without firing \\non the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children who are mingled with the mob. A commits no offence if by \\nso firing he harms any of the children. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nCHAPTER V \\n\\nOF ABETMENT \\n\\n107. Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the doing of a thing, who— \\n\\nFirst.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or \\n\\nSecondly.—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that \\nthing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of \\nthat thing; or \\n\\nThirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material \\nfact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing \\nto be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z, B, knowing that fact and also that C is \\nnot Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the \\napprehension of C. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in \\norder to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid \\nthe doing of that act. \\n\\n108.  Abettor.—A  person  abets  an  offence,  who  abets  either  the  commission  of  an  offence,  or  the \\ncommission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing \\nan offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence although the \\n\\nabettor may not himself be bound to do that act. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should be \\n\\ncommitted, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of instigating \\n\\nB to commit murder. \\n\\nExplanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an \\noffence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty \\nintention or knowledge. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n30 \\n\\n\\x0cIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person \\ncapable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is \\nguilty of abetting an offence. \\n\\n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z\\'s death. \\nB, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z\\'s death. Here, though B was not capable \\nby law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an \\noffence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. \\n\\n(c)  A  instigates  B  to  set  fire  to  a  dwelling-house.  B,  in  consequence  of  the  unsoundness  of  his  mind,  being  incapable  of \\nknowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A\\'s \\ninstigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to \\nthe punishment provided for that offence. \\n\\n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession. A induces \\nB to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z\\'s possession, in good faith, believing it to be A\\'s property. \\nB, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, \\nand is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. \\n\\nExplanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also \\n\\nan offence. \\n\\nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence \\nof B\\'s instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the \\noffence, A is also liable to the same punishment. \\n\\nExplanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that \\nthe abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the \\nconspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. \\n\\nA  concerts  with  B  a  plan  for  poisoning  Z.  It  is  agreed  that  A  shall  administer  the  poison.  B  then  explains  the  plan  to  C \\nmentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A\\'s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and \\nprocures  and  delivers  it  to  B  for  the  purpose  of  its  being  used  in  the  manner  explained.  A  administers  the  poison;  Z  dies  in \\nconsequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which \\nZ has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder. \\n\\n108A. Abetment in India of offences outside India.—A person abets an offence within the meaning \\nof this Code who, in India, abets the commission of any act without and beyond  India which would \\nconstitute an offence if committed in India. \\n\\nA, in India, instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa, A is guilty of abetting murder.] \\n\\n109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express \\nprovision is made for its punishment.—Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed \\nin consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such \\nabetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. \\n\\nExplanation.—An  act  or  offence  is  said  to  be  committed  in  consequence  of  abetment,  when  it  is \\ncommitted  in  consequence  of  the  instigation,  or  in  pursuance  of  the  conspiracy,  or  with  the  aid  which \\nconstitutes the abetment. \\n\\n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the exercise of B\\'s official functions. B \\n\\naccepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined in section 161. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Added by Act 4 of 1898, s. 3. \\n2. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A.O. 1948, the A.O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch., to \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n31 \\n\\nread as above. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting \\n\\nthat offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B. \\n\\n(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he \\nmay administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A’s absence and thereby causes Z’s death. \\nHere B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder. \\n\\n110.  Punishment  of  abetment  if  person  abetted  does  act  with  different  intention  from  that  of \\nabettor.—Whoever  abets the  commission of  an  offence  shall,  if the  person  abetted  does  the  act  with  a \\ndifferent intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for the \\noffence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge of the \\nabettor and with no other. \\n\\n111. Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done.—When an Act is abetted and \\na different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent as if \\nhe had directly abetted it: \\n\\nProvided  the  act  done  was  a  probable  consequence  of  the  abetment,  and  was  committed  under  the \\ninfluence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the abetment. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. The \\nchild, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y, which is by the side \\nof that of Z. Here, if the child was acting under the influence of A\\'s instigation, and the act done was under \\nthe circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable in the same manner and to the same \\nextent as if he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to burn Z’s house B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of \\nproperty there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for \\nthe theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning. \\n\\n(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and \\nprovides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the \\ninmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the \\npunishment provided for murder. \\n\\n112. Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done.—If the act \\nfor which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committed in addition to the act abetted, \\nand constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences. \\n\\nA instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence, resists that distress. In offering the \\nresistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the distress. As B has committed both the offence of resisting \\nthe distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and, if A knew \\nthat B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each of the \\noffences. \\n\\n113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different from that intended by \\nthe abettor.—When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular \\neffect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a different effect \\nfrom that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in the same manner and to the \\nsame extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the \\nact abetted was likely to cause that effect. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA  instigates  B  to  cause  grievous  hurt  to  Z.  B,  in  consequence  of  the  instigation,  causes  grievous  hurt  to  Z.  Z  dies  in \\nconsequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the punishment \\nprovided for murder. \\n\\n114. Abettor present when offence is committed.—Whenever any person, who is absent would be \\nliable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in \\nconsequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence. \\n\\n \\n\\n32 \\n\\n\\x0c115.  Abetment  of  offence  punishable  with  death  or  imprisonment  for  life.—if  offence  not \\ncommitted.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for \\nlife, shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is \\nmade  by  this  Code  for  the  punishment  of  such  abetment,  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either \\ndescription for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine; \\n\\nif  act  causing  harm  be  done  in  consequence.—and  if  any  act  for  which  the  abettor  is  liable  in \\nconsequence of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable to \\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be liable \\nto fine. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA instigates B to murder Z. The offence is not committed. If B had murdered Z, he would have been subject to the punishment \\nof death or imprisonment for life. Therefore A is liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and also to \\na fine; and if any hurt be done to Z in consequence of the abetment, he will be liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend \\nto fourteen years, and to fine. \\n\\n116. Abetment of offence punishable with imprisonment—if offence be not committed.—Whoever \\nabets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of \\nthe  abetment,  and  no  express  provision  is  made  by  this  Code  for  the  punishment  of  such  abetment,  be \\npunished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence for a term which may extend to \\none-fourth  part  of  the  longest  term  provided  for  that  offence;  or  with  such  fine  as  is  provided  for  that \\noffence, or with both; \\n\\nif abettor or person abetted be a public servant whose duty it is to prevent offence.—and if the \\nabettor or the person abetted is a public servant, whose duty it is to prevent the commission of such offence, \\nthe abettor shall be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence, for a term \\nwhich may extend to one-half of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such fine as is provided \\nfor the offence, or with both. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing. A somefavour in the exercise of B’s official functions. B \\n\\nrefuses to accept the bribe. A is punishable under this section. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. Here, if B does not give false evidence, A has nevertheless committed the offence \\n\\ndefined in this section, and is punishable accordingly. \\n\\n(c) A, a police-officer, whose duty it is to prevent robbery, abets the commission of robbery. Here, though the robbery be not \\n\\ncommitted, A is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for that offence, and also to fine. \\n\\n(d) B abets the commission of a robbery by A, a police-officer, whose duty it is to prevent that offence. Here, though the \\nrobbery be not committed, B is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for the offence of robbery, and also \\nto fine. \\n\\n117. Abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than ten persons.—Whoever abets \\nthe commission of an offence by the public generally or by any number or class of persons exceeding ten, \\nshall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or \\nwith fine, or with both. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA affixes in a public place a placard instigating a sect consisting of more than ten members to meet at a certain time and place, \\nfor the purpose of attacking the members of an adverse sect, while engaged in a procession. A has committed the offence defined \\nin this section. \\n\\n118.  Concealing  design  to  commit  offence  punishable  with  death  or  imprisonment  for  life.—\\nWhoever intending to facilitate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby facilitate the commission of \\nan offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                           \\n1.

A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient \\nin the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring \\nunder any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here \\nA, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury \\nas in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. \\n\\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. \\n\\nZ dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z\\'s death. \\n\\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although \\n\\nhe may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. \\n\\nException  1.—When  culpable  homicide  is  not  murder.—Culpable  homicide  is  not  murder  if  the \\noffender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death \\nof the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. \\n\\nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos:— \\n\\nFirst.—That the  provocation  is  not  sought  or  voluntarily  provoked  by  the offender as an  excuse for \\n\\nkilling or doing harm to any person. \\n\\nSecondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public \\n\\nservant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. \\n\\nThirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private \\n\\ndefence. \\n\\n \\n\\n73 \\n\\n\\x0cExplanation.—Whether  the  provocation  was  grave  and  sudden  enough  to  prevent  the  offence  from \\n\\namounting to murder is a question of fact. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z\\'s child. This is murder, \\ninasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in \\ndoing an act caused by the provocation. \\n\\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing \\nhimself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable \\nhomicide. \\n\\n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, \\n\\ninasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. \\n\\n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A\\'s deposition, and that A has \\n\\nperjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. \\n\\n(e)A attempts to pull Z\\'s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. \\nA is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by \\na thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. \\n\\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B\\'s rage, and to \\ncause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B\\'s hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable \\nhomicide, but A is guilty of murder. \\n\\nException 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the right \\nof private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of \\nthe person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any \\nintention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. \\nA  believing  in  good  faith  that  he  can  by  no  other  means  prevent  himself  from  being  horsewhipped,  shoots  Z  dead.  A  has  not \\ncommitted murder, but only culpable homicide. \\n\\nException 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public \\nservant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes \\ndeath by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of \\nhis duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused. \\n\\nException 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden \\nfight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender\\'s having taken undue advantage \\nor acted in a cruel or unusual manner. \\n\\nExplanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first \\n\\nassault. \\n\\nException 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above \\n\\nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z\\'s youth, \\n\\nhe was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder. \\n\\n301.  Culpable  homicide  by  causing  death  of  person  other  than  person  whose  death  was \\nintended.—If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, commits \\nculpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither intends nor knows himself \\nto be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of which it \\nwould have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or knew himself to he \\nlikely to cause. \\n\\n \\n\\n74 \\n\\n\\x0c302.  Punishment  for  murder.—Whoever  commits  murder  shall  be  punished  with  death  or \\n\\nimprisonment for life,  and shall also be liable to fine. \\n\\n303. Punishment for murder by life-convict.—Whoever, being under sentence of imprisonment for \\n\\nlife, commits murder, shall be punished with death. \\n\\n304. Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.—Whoever commits culpable \\nhomicide not amounting to murder, shall be punished with  imprisonment for life, or imprisonment of \\neither description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by \\nwhich the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is \\nlikely to cause death; \\n\\nor with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or \\nwith both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to \\ncause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. \\n\\n304A. Causing death by negligence.—Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash \\nor  negligent  act  not  amounting  to  culpable  homicide,  shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either \\ndescription for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. \\n\\nHimachal Pradesh.— \\n\\nSTATE AMENDMENTS \\n\\nAfter Section 304 A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860,  in its application to the State of Himachal \\n\\nPradesh, the following section shall be added, namely: — \\n\\n“304-AA.

Force.—A  person  is  said  to  use  force  to  another  if  he  causes  motion,  change  of  motion,  or \\ncessation of motion to that other, or if he causes to any substance such motion, or change of motion, or \\ncessation of motion as brings that substance into contact with any part of that other\\'s body, or with anything \\nwhich that other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so situated that such contact affects that other\\'s \\nsense of feeling: Provided that the person causing the motion, or change of motion, or cessation of motion, \\ncauses that motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion in one of the three ways hereinafter described: \\n\\nFirst.—By his own bodily power. \\n\\nSecondly.—By disposing any substance in such a manner that the motion or change or cessation of \\n\\nmotion takes place without any further act on his part, or on the part of any other person. \\n\\nThirdly.—By inducing any animal to move, to change its motion, or to cease to move. \\n\\n350. Criminal force.—Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person\\'s consent, \\nin order to the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force to cause, or knowing it to \\nbe likely that by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the \\nforce is used, is said to use criminal force to that other. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the \\nstream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is \\nproduced without any other action on any person\\'s part. A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without \\nZ\\'s consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will cause injury, \\nfear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z\\'s horses, and thereby causes them to quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of \\nmotion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z\\'s \\nconsent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of \\nmotion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, \\nwithout Z\\'s consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his own person so as to bring it \\ninto contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z\\'s consent, intending or knowing \\nit to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z\\'s \\nclothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z\\'s clothes or something carried \\nby Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z\\'s clothes, A \\nhas used force to Z, and if he did so without Z\\'s consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force \\nto Z. \\n\\n(f) A intentionally pulls up a Woman\\'s veil. Here  A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does so without her consent \\n\\nintending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her. \\n\\n(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by his own bodily power \\ncauses such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact \\nmust affect Z\\'s sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without Z\\'s consent intending \\nor knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force. \\n\\n(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z\\'s consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses \\n\\ncriminal force to Z. \\n\\n \\n\\n82 \\n\\n\\x0c351. Assault.—Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely \\nthat such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture \\nor preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault. \\n\\nExplanation.—Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give \\nto his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an \\nassault. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike \\n\\nZ. A has committed an assault. \\n\\n(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to \\n\\nbelieve that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A has committed an assault upon Z. \\n\\n(c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, “I will give you a beating”. Here, though the words used by A could in no case amount to \\nan assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault,the gesture \\nexplained by the words may amount to an assault. \\n\\n352. Punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation.—Whoever \\nassaults or uses criminal force to any person otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation given by that \\nperson, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three \\nmonths, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both. \\n\\nExplanation.—Grave and sudden provocation will not mitigate the punishment for an offence under \\nthis  section,  if  the  provocation  is  sought  or  voluntarily  provoked  by  the  offender  as  an  excuse  for  the \\noffence, or \\n\\nif the provocation is given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant, in the \\n\\nlawful exercise of the powers of such public servant, or \\n\\nif the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. \\n\\n Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate the offence, is a question of fact. \\n\\n353.  Assault  or  criminal  force  to  deter  public  servant  from  discharge  of  his  duty.—Whoever \\nassaults or uses criminal force to any person being a public servant in the execution of his duty as such \\npublic servant, or with intent to prevent or deter that person from discharging his duty as such public servant, \\nor in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by such person to the lawful discharge of his \\nduty as such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which \\nmay extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. \\n\\nSTATE AMENDMENT \\n\\nAmendment of section 353 of 45 of 1860.—In section 353 of the said Code, for the words “two years” \\n\\nMaharashtra.— \\n\\nthe words “five years” shall be substituted. \\n\\n[Vide Maharashtra Act 40 of 2018, sec. 3] \\n\\n354.

Theft.—Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of \\nany person without that person\\'s consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit \\ntheft. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the \\nsubject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft. \\n\\nExplanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it \\n\\nfrom moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. \\n\\nExplanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, \\n\\nand to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. \\n\\nExplanation 5.—The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be given \\neither by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or \\nimplied. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A cuts down a tree on Z\\'s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent. \\n\\nHere, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft. \\n\\n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z\\'s dog to follow it. Here, if A\\'s intention be dishonestly to take the \\n\\ndog out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z\\'s dog has begun to follow A. \\n\\n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly \\n\\ntake the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. \\n\\n(d) A being Z\\'s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z\\'s plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z\\'s consent. \\n\\nA has committed theft. \\n\\n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith \\nand sells it. Here the plate was not in Z\\'s possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z\\'s possession, and A has not committed \\ntheft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. \\n\\n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z\\'s possession, and if A dishonestly \\n\\nremoves it, A commits theft. \\n\\ncommit criminal misappropriation of property. \\n\\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may \\n\\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z\\'s house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear \\nof search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention \\nof taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first  moving the ring, \\ncommits theft. \\n\\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for \\nwhich the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z\\'s hand, \\nand carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as \\nwhat he did was not done dishonestly.  \\n\\n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the \\nwatch out of Z\\'s possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch \\nas he takes it dishonestly. \\n\\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent, not having paid what he \\n\\nborrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \\n\\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains \\n\\nmoney from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. \\n\\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z\\'s library in Z\\'s absence, and takes away a book without Z\\'s express consent \\nfor the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he \\nhad Z\\'s implied consent to use Z\\'s book. If this was A\\'s impression, A has not committed theft. \\n\\n(n) A asks charity from Z\\'s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is \\nprobable that A may conceive that Z\\'s wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A\\'s impression, A has not committed theft. \\n\\n(o) A is the paramour of Z\\'s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such \\n\\nproperty as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. \\n\\n \\n\\n95 \\n\\n\\x0c(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A\\'s own property, takes that property out of B\\'s possession. Here, \\n\\nas A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. \\n\\n379.

A has committed the offence defined in this section. \\n\\n(b)  A  picks  Z\\'s  pocket,  having posted  several  of  his  companions near  him,  in order that they  may  restrain  Z,  if  Z  should \\nperceive what is passing and should resist, or should attempt to apprehend A.

Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). \\n\\n \\n\\n99 \\n\\n\\x0cIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A takes property belonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession, in good faith believing at the time when he takes it, that the property \\nbelongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own \\nuse, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\n(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z\\'s library in Z\\'s absence, and takes away a book without Z\\'s express consent. \\nHere, if  A  was under the impression that he had Z\\'s implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has not \\ncommitted theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\n(c) A and B, being, joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B\\'s possession, intending to use it. Here, as A has a right \\nto use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it.

A, in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum \\n\\n1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.  \\n\\n(b) A, without Z\\'s authority, affixes Z\\'s seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling \\n\\nthe estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently \\n\\nfills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery. \\n\\n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable and authorizes B to fill up the cheque \\nby inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting \\nthe sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery. \\n\\n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B\\'s authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and \\nintending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the \\nsecurity of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery. \\n\\n(f) Z\\'s will contains these words—“I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B and C.” A dishonestly scratches \\n\\nout B\\'s name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. The words “TRADE OR” omitted by Act 43 of 1958, s. 135 and Sch. (w.e.f. 25-11-1959). \\n2.

Subs. by Act 10 of 2009, s. 51, for “digital signature” (w.e.f. 27-10-2009). \\n\\n \\n\\n109 \\n\\n\\x0c(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words “Pay to Z or his order” \\nand signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank \\nendorsement. B commits forgery. \\n\\n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated \\nsix months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. \\nA has committed forgery. \\n\\n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will \\n\\naccording to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B\\'s name without B\\'s authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances \\nfrom unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order \\nto induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(k) A without B\\'s authority writes a letter and signs it in B\\'s name certifying to A\\'s character, intending thereby to obtain employment under \\nZ. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or \\nimplied contract for service. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. \\n\\nA has committed forgery. \\n\\n(b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z\\'s name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of \\nexchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws \\nthe bill upon the paper pursuant to A\\'s intention, B is also guilty of forgery. \\n\\n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending \\n\\nto cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of \\nthe estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it \\nto be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it. \\n\\n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A\\'s benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to give \\na colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it \\nmay be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictious person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by \\na real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount \\nto forgery. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it. \\nA commits forgery. \\n\\nExplanation 3.—For the purposes of this section, the expression “affixing electronic signature” shall have the \\nmeaning assigned to it in clause (d) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (21 of \\n2000).] \\n\\n465.

Punishment of person guilty of one of several offences, the judgment stating that it is doubtful \\nof  which.—In  all  cases  in  which  judgment  is  given  that  a  person  is  guilty  of  one  of  several  offences \\nspecified in the judgment, but that it is doubtful of which of these offences he is guilty, the offender shall \\nbe punished for the offence for which the lowest punishment is provided if the same punishment is not \\nprovided for all. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Ins. by Act 8 of 1882, s. 3. \\n2. Added by s. 4, ibid. \\n\\n \\n\\n23 \\n\\n\\x0c73. Solitary confinement.—Whenever any person is convicted of an offence for which under this Code \\nthe Court has power to sentence him to rigorous imprisonment, the Court may, by its sentence, order that \\nthe offender shall be kept in solitary confinement for any portion or portions of the imprisonment to which \\nhe is sentenced, not exceeding three months in the whole, according to the following scale, that is to say— \\n\\na time not exceeding one month if the term of imprisonment shall not exceed six months; \\n\\na time not exceeding two months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed six months andshall not \\n\\nexceed one year \\n\\na time not exceeding three months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed one year. \\n\\n74.  Limit  of  solitary  confinement.—In  executing  a  sentence  of  solitary  confinement,  such \\nconfinement shall in no case exceed fourteen days at a time, with intervals between the periods of solitary \\nconfinement of not less duration than such periods; and when the imprisonment awarded shall exceed three \\nmonths, the solitary confinement shall not exceed seven days in any one month of the whole imprisonment \\nawarded, with intervals between the periods of solitary confinement of not less duration than such periods. \\n\\n75.  Enhanced  punishment  for  certain  offences  under  Chapter  XII  or  Chapter  XVII  after \\n\\nprevious conviction.—Whoever, having been convicted,— \\n\\n(a) by a Court in India, of an offence punishable under Chapter XII or Chapter XVII of this Code \\n\\nwith imprisonment of either description for a term of three years or upwards, shall be guilty of any offence punishable under either of those Chapters with like imprisonment for the like \\nterm, shall be subject for every such subsequent offence to imprisonment for life, or to imprisonment of \\neither description for a term which may extend to ten years.] \\n\\nCHAPTER IV \\n\\nGENERAL EXCEPTIONS \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n76. Act done by a person bound, or by mistake of fact believing himself bound, by law.—Nothing \\nis an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of \\na mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be, bound by law to do it. \\n\\n(a)  A,  a  soldier,  fires  on  a  mob by  the  order  of  his  superior  officer,  in  conformity  with  the  commands  of  the  law.  A  has \\n\\ncommitted no offence. \\n\\narrests Z. A has committed no offence. \\n\\n(b) A, an officer of a Court of Justice, being ordered by that Court to arrest Y, and after due enquiry, believing Z to be Y, \\n\\n77.  Act  of  Judge when  acting judicially.—Nothing  is  an offence  which  is  done  by  a  Judge  when \\nacting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which in good faith he believes to be, given to \\nhim by law. \\n\\n78. Act done pursuant to the judgment or order of Court.—Nothing which is done in pursuance of, \\nor which is warranted by the judgment or order of, a Court of Justice; if done whilst such judgment or order \\nremains  in  force,  is  an  offence,  notwithstanding  the  Court  may  have  had  no  jurisdiction  to  pass  such \\njudgment  or  order,  provided  the  person  doing  the  act  in  good  faith  believes  that  the  Court  had  such \\njurisdiction. \\n\\n79. Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself, justified, by law.—\\nNothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Subs. by Act 8 of 1862, s. 5, for “be less than a”. \\n2. Subs. by Act 3 of 1910, s. 2, for section 75. \\n3. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A. O. 1948, the A. O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch., \\n\\nto read as above. \\n\\n4. The word “or” omitted by Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch. \\n5. Cl. (b) omitted by s. 3 and the Sch., ibid. \\n6. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). \\n\\n \\n\\n24 \\n\\n\\x0cof fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith, believes himself to be justified by law, in doing \\nit. \\n\\nA sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, of the \\npower which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in the fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper \\nauthorities. A has committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in self-defence. \\n\\n80. Accident in doing a lawful act.—Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, \\nand without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful \\nmeans and with proper care and caution. \\n\\nA is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here, if there was no want of proper caution \\n\\non the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence. \\n\\n81.  Act  likely  to  cause  harm,  but  done without  criminal intent,  and  to  prevent  other  harm.—\\nNothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause harm, \\nif it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of preventing \\nor avoiding other harm to person or property. \\n\\nExplanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was \\nof such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that it \\nwas likely to cause harm. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly, and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a position \\nthat, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless  he \\nchanges the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with only two \\npassengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in \\ngood faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run \\ndown the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger \\nwhich he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C. \\n\\n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention \\nin good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so \\nimminent as to excuse A\\'s act, A is not guilty of the offence. \\n\\n82. Act of a child under seven years of age.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under \\n\\nseven years of age.  \\n\\n83.  Act  of  a  child  above  seven  and  under  twelve  of  immature  understanding.—Nothing  is  an \\noffence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under twelve, who has not attained sufficient \\nmaturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion. \\n\\n84. Act of a person of unsound mind.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the \\ntime of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he \\nis doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. \\n\\n85. Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will.—\\nNothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, \\nincapable  of  knowing  the  nature  of  the  act,  or  that  he  is  doing  what  is  either  wrong,  or  contrary  to  \\nlaw;  provided  that  the  thing  which  intoxicated  him  was  administered  to  him  without  his  knowledge  or \\nagainst his will. \\n\\n86. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.—In \\ncases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person who \\ndoes the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge as he \\nwould have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was administered to \\nhim without his knowledge or against his will. \\n\\n87.  Act  not  intended  and  not  known  to  be  likely  to  cause  death  or  grievous  hurt,  done  by \\nconsent.—Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the \\ndoer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, \\nor be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has given consent, \\n\\n \\n\\n25 \\n\\n\\x0cwhether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the \\ndoer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm. \\n\\nA and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which, \\n\\nin the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence. \\n\\n88. Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person\\'s benefit.—Nothing, \\nwhich is not intented to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended \\nby the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is \\ndone in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm, or to take \\nthe risk of that harm. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who suffers under the painful complaint, \\nbut not intending to cause Z\\'s death, and intending, in good faith, Z\\'s benefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z\\'s consent. A has \\ncommitted no offence. \\n\\n89. Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, by or by consent of guardian.—\\nNothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or of unsound \\nmind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of \\nthat person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause or \\nbe known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: Provided— \\n\\nProvisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or to the \\n\\nattempting to cause death; \\n\\nSecondly.—That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing it \\nknows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, \\nor the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\n\\nThirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the \\nattempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or \\nthe curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\n\\nFourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing \\n\\nof which offence it would not extend. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, in good faith, for his child\\'s benefit without his child\\'s consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon knowing it to \\nbe likely that the operation will cause the child\\'s death, but not intending to cause the child\\'s death. A is within the exception,  \\ninasmuch as his object was the cure of the child. \\n\\n90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.—A consent is not such a consent as is \\nintended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a \\nmisconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent was \\ngiven in consequence of such fear or misconception; or \\n\\nConsent of insane person.—if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or \\n\\nintoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or \\n\\nConsent of child.—unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person \\n\\nwho is under twelve years of age. \\n\\n91. Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm cause.—The exceptions in sections \\n87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they may cause, \\nor be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or on whose \\nbehalf the consent is given. \\n\\nCausing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is offence independently of \\nany harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”; and \\nthe consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\n26 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c92. Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.—Nothing is an offence by reason \\nof any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without that \\nperson\\'s consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, or if \\nthat person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of him from \\nwhom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided— \\n\\nProvisos.  First.—That  this  exception  shall  not  extend  to  the  intentional  causing  of  death,  or  the \\n\\nattempting to cause death; \\n\\nSecondly.—That this exception shall not extend  to the doing of anything which the person doing it \\nknows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or \\nthe curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\n\\nThirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to \\n\\ncause hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt; \\n\\nFourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing of \\n\\nwhich offence it would not extend. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be trepanned. A, not intending Z\\'s death, \\nbut in good faith, for Z\\'s benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed no \\noffence. \\n\\n(b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill Z, but not intending to kill Z, \\n\\nand in good faith intending Z\\'s benefit. A\\'s ball gives Z a mortal wound. A has committed no offence. \\n\\n(c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an operation be immediately performed. \\nThere is not time to apply to the child\\'s guardian. A performs the operation in spite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in good \\nfaith, the child\\'s benefit. A has committed no offence. \\n\\n(d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A drops the child from the house stop, \\nknowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child\\'s \\nbenefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence. \\n\\nExplanation.—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 88, 89 and 92. \\n\\n93. Communication made in good faith.—No communication made in good faith is an offence by \\n\\nreason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live. The patient dies in consequence of the \\n\\nshock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient\\'s death. \\n\\n94. Act to which a person is compelled by threats.—Except murder, and offences against the State \\npunishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, \\nwhich,  at  the  time  of  doing  it,  reasonably  cause  the  apprehension  that  instant  death  to  that  person  will \\notherwise  be  the  consequence:  Provided  the  person  doing  the  act  did  not  of  his  own  accord,  or  from  a \\nreasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which \\nhe became subject to such constraint. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins a gang \\nof dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the ground of his \\nhaving been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant death, to do a \\nthing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of \\na house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception. \\n\\n95. Act causing slight harm.—Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to \\ncause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of ordinary \\nsense and temper would complain of such harm. \\n\\n96. Things done in private defence.—Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right \\n\\n \\nOf the Right of Private Defence \\n\\n27 \\n\\nof private defence. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c97. Right of private defence of the body and of property.—Every person has a right, subject to the \\n\\nrestrictions contained in section 99, to defend— \\n\\nFirst.—His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human body; \\n\\nSecondly.—The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against \\nany act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or \\nwhich is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass. \\n\\n98. Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc.—When an act, which \\nwould otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of maturity of \\nunderstanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by reason of any \\nmisconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence against that act \\nwhich he would have if the act were that offence. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. But A has the same right of private defence \\n\\nwhich he would have if Z were sane. \\n\\n(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A. \\nHere Z, by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z, which \\nhe would have if Z were not acting under that misconception. \\n\\n99. Acts against which there is no right of private defence.—There is no right of private defence \\nagainst an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or \\nattempted to be done, by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that act, \\nmay not be strictly justifiable by law. \\n\\nThere is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension \\nof death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant acting in \\ngood faith under colour of his office, though that direction may not be strictly justifiable by law. \\n\\nThere is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to protection of the \\n\\npublic authorities. \\n\\nExtent to which the right may be exercised.—The right of private defence in no case extends to the \\n\\ninflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence. \\n\\nExplanation  1.—A  person  is  not  deprived  of  the  right  of  private  defence  against  an  act  done,  or \\nattempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows or has reason to believe, that the person \\ndoing the act is such public servant. \\n\\nExplanation  2.—A  person  is  not  deprived  of  the  right  of  private  defence  against  an  act  done,  or \\nattempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that \\nthe person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such person states the authority under which \\nhe acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded. \\n\\n100. When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death.—The right of private \\ndefence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section, to the voluntary \\ncausing of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the offence which occasions the exercise of the \\nright be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:— \\n\\nFirst.—Such  an  assault  as  may  reasonably  cause  the  apprehension  that  death  will  otherwise  be  the \\n\\nconsequence of such assault; \\n\\nbe the consequence of such assault; \\n\\nSecondly.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise \\n\\nThirdly.—An assault with the intention of committing rape; \\n\\nFourthly.—An assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust; \\n\\nFifthly.—An assault with the intention of kidnapping or abducting; \\n\\nSixthly.—An assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under circumstances which \\nmay reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the public authorities for \\nhis release. \\n\\n \\n\\n28 \\n\\n\\x0cSeventhly.—An act of throwing or administering acid or an attempt to throw or administer acid which \\nmay reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such act. \\n\\n101. When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.—If the offence be not of any \\nof the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, the right of private defence of the body does \\nnot  extend  to  the  voluntary  causing  of  death  to  the  assailant,  but  does  extend,  under  the  restrictions \\nmentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death. \\n\\n102. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body.—The right of \\nprivate defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises \\nfrom an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed; and it \\ncontinues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues. \\n\\n103. When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death.—The right of private \\ndefence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the  voluntary causing of \\ndeath or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to \\ncommit  which,  occasions  the  exercise  of  the  right,  be  an  offence  of  any  of  the  descriptions  hereinafter \\nenumerated, namely:— \\n\\nFirst.—Robbery; \\n\\nSecondly.—House-breaking by night; \\n\\nThirdly.—Mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is \\n\\nused as a human dwelling, or as a place for the custody of property; \\n\\nFourthly.—Theft,  mischief,  or  house-trespass,  under  such  circumstances  as  may  reasonably  cause \\napprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of private defence is not \\nexercised. \\n\\nSTATE AMENDMENTS \\n\\nKarnataka \\n\\n(1) In section 103, in clause Thirdly, — \\n\\n(i) after the words “mischief by fire”, the words “or any explosive substance” Shall be inserted; \\n\\n(ii) after the words “as a human dwelling, or”the words “as a place of worship, or” shall be inserted. \\n\\n(2) After clause Fourthly, the following clause shall be inserted namely:— \\n\\n“Fifthly.— Mischief by fire or any explosive substance committed on any property used or intended to \\nbe  used  for  the  purpose  of  Government  or  any  local  authority,  statutory  body  or  company  owned  or \\ncontrolled by Government or railway or any vehicle used or adapted to be used for the carriage of passengers \\nfor hire or reward”. \\n\\n[Vide Karnataka Act 8 of 1972, sec. 2]. \\n\\n104.  When  such  right  extends  to  causing  any  harm  other  than  death.—If  the  offence,  the \\ncommitting  of  which,  or  the  attempting  to  commit  which  occasions  the  exercise  of  the  right  of  private \\ndefence,  be  theft,  mischief,  or  criminal  trespass,  not  of  any  of  the  descriptions  enumerated  in  the  last \\npreceding section, that right does not extend to the voluntary causing of death, but does extend, subject to \\nthe restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the wrong-doer of any harm other than \\ndeath. \\n\\n105. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of property.—The right of \\nprivate  defence  of  property  commences  when  a  reasonable  apprehension  of  danger  to  the  property \\ncommences. \\n\\nThe right of private defence of property against theft continues till the offender has effected his retreat \\nwith  the  property  or  either  the  assistance  of the public  authorities is  obtained,  or  the property  has  been \\nrecovered. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Ins. by Act 13 of 2013, s. 2 (w.e.f. 3-2-2013). \\n\\n29 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cThe right of private defence of property against robbery continues as long as the offender causes or \\nattempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or as long as the fear of instant death or \\nof instant hurt or of instant personal restraint continues. \\n\\nThe right of private defence of property against criminal trespass or mischief continues as long as the \\n\\noffender continues in the commission of criminal trespass or mischief. \\n\\nThe right of private defence of property against house-breaking by night continues as long as the house-\\n\\ntrespass which has been begun by such house-breaking continues. \\n\\n106.  Right  of  private  defence  against  deadly  assault  when  there  is  risk  of  harm  to  innocent \\nperson.—If in the exercise of the right of private defence against an assault which reasonably causes the \\napprehension of death, the defender be so situated that he cannot effectually exercise that right without risk \\nof harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of that risk. \\n\\nA is attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his right of private defence without firing \\non the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children who are mingled with the mob. A commits no offence if by \\nso firing he harms any of the children. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nCHAPTER V \\n\\nOF ABETMENT \\n\\n107. Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the doing of a thing, who— \\n\\nFirst.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or \\n\\nSecondly.—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that \\nthing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of \\nthat thing; or \\n\\nThirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material \\nfact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing \\nto be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z, B, knowing that fact and also that C is \\nnot Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the \\napprehension of C. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in \\norder to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid \\nthe doing of that act. \\n\\n108.  Abettor.—A  person  abets  an  offence,  who  abets  either  the  commission  of  an  offence,  or  the \\ncommission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing \\nan offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence although the \\n\\nabettor may not himself be bound to do that act. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should be \\n\\ncommitted, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of instigating \\n\\nB to commit murder. \\n\\nExplanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an \\noffence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty \\nintention or knowledge. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n30 \\n\\n\\x0cIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person \\ncapable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is \\nguilty of abetting an offence. \\n\\n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z\\'s death. \\nB, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z\\'s death. Here, though B was not capable \\nby law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an \\noffence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. \\n\\n(c)  A  instigates  B  to  set  fire  to  a  dwelling-house.  B,  in  consequence  of  the  unsoundness  of  his  mind,  being  incapable  of \\nknowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A\\'s \\ninstigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to \\nthe punishment provided for that offence. \\n\\n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession. A induces \\nB to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z\\'s possession, in good faith, believing it to be A\\'s property. \\nB, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, \\nand is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. \\n\\nExplanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also \\n\\nan offence. \\n\\nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence \\nof B\\'s instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the \\noffence, A is also liable to the same punishment. \\n\\nExplanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that \\nthe abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the \\nconspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. \\n\\nA  concerts  with  B  a  plan  for  poisoning  Z.  It  is  agreed  that  A  shall  administer  the  poison.  B  then  explains  the  plan  to  C \\nmentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A\\'s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and \\nprocures  and  delivers  it  to  B  for  the  purpose  of  its  being  used  in  the  manner  explained.  A  administers  the  poison;  Z  dies  in \\nconsequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which \\nZ has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder. \\n\\n108A. Abetment in India of offences outside India.—A person abets an offence within the meaning \\nof this Code who, in India, abets the commission of any act without and beyond  India which would \\nconstitute an offence if committed in India. \\n\\nA, in India, instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa, A is guilty of abetting murder.] \\n\\n109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express \\nprovision is made for its punishment.—Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed \\nin consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such \\nabetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. \\n\\nExplanation.—An  act  or  offence  is  said  to  be  committed  in  consequence  of  abetment,  when  it  is \\ncommitted  in  consequence  of  the  instigation,  or  in  pursuance  of  the  conspiracy,  or  with  the  aid  which \\nconstitutes the abetment. \\n\\n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the exercise of B\\'s official functions. B \\n\\naccepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined in section 161. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Added by Act 4 of 1898, s. 3. \\n2. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A.O. 1948, the A.O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch., to \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n31 \\n\\nread as above. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting \\n\\nthat offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B. \\n\\n(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he \\nmay administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A’s absence and thereby causes Z’s death. \\nHere B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder. \\n\\n110.  Punishment  of  abetment  if  person  abetted  does  act  with  different  intention  from  that  of \\nabettor.—Whoever  abets the  commission of  an  offence  shall,  if the  person  abetted  does  the  act  with  a \\ndifferent intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for the \\noffence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge of the \\nabettor and with no other. \\n\\n111. Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done.—When an Act is abetted and \\na different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent as if \\nhe had directly abetted it: \\n\\nProvided  the  act  done  was  a  probable  consequence  of  the  abetment,  and  was  committed  under  the \\ninfluence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the abetment. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. The \\nchild, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y, which is by the side \\nof that of Z. Here, if the child was acting under the influence of A\\'s instigation, and the act done was under \\nthe circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable in the same manner and to the same \\nextent as if he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to burn Z’s house B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of \\nproperty there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for \\nthe theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning. \\n\\n(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and \\nprovides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the \\ninmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the \\npunishment provided for murder. \\n\\n112. Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done.—If the act \\nfor which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committed in addition to the act abetted, \\nand constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences. \\n\\nA instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence, resists that distress. In offering the \\nresistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the distress. As B has committed both the offence of resisting \\nthe distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and, if A knew \\nthat B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each of the \\noffences. \\n\\n113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different from that intended by \\nthe abettor.—When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular \\neffect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a different effect \\nfrom that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in the same manner and to the \\nsame extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the \\nact abetted was likely to cause that effect. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA  instigates  B  to  cause  grievous  hurt  to  Z.  B,  in  consequence  of  the  instigation,  causes  grievous  hurt  to  Z.  Z  dies  in \\nconsequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the punishment \\nprovided for murder. \\n\\n114. Abettor present when offence is committed.—Whenever any person, who is absent would be \\nliable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in \\nconsequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence. \\n\\n \\n\\n32 \\n\\n\\x0c115.  Abetment  of  offence  punishable  with  death  or  imprisonment  for  life.—if  offence  not \\ncommitted.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for \\nlife, shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is \\nmade  by  this  Code  for  the  punishment  of  such  abetment,  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either \\ndescription for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine; \\n\\nif  act  causing  harm  be  done  in  consequence.—and  if  any  act  for  which  the  abettor  is  liable  in \\nconsequence of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable to \\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be liable \\nto fine. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA instigates B to murder Z. The offence is not committed. If B had murdered Z, he would have been subject to the punishment \\nof death or imprisonment for life. Therefore A is liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and also to \\na fine; and if any hurt be done to Z in consequence of the abetment, he will be liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend \\nto fourteen years, and to fine. \\n\\n116. Abetment of offence punishable with imprisonment—if offence be not committed.—Whoever \\nabets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of \\nthe  abetment,  and  no  express  provision  is  made  by  this  Code  for  the  punishment  of  such  abetment,  be \\npunished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence for a term which may extend to \\none-fourth  part  of  the  longest  term  provided  for  that  offence;  or  with  such  fine  as  is  provided  for  that \\noffence, or with both; \\n\\nif abettor or person abetted be a public servant whose duty it is to prevent offence.—and if the \\nabettor or the person abetted is a public servant, whose duty it is to prevent the commission of such offence, \\nthe abettor shall be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence, for a term \\nwhich may extend to one-half of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such fine as is provided \\nfor the offence, or with both. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing. A somefavour in the exercise of B’s official functions. B \\n\\nrefuses to accept the bribe. A is punishable under this section. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. Here, if B does not give false evidence, A has nevertheless committed the offence \\n\\ndefined in this section, and is punishable accordingly. \\n\\n(c) A, a police-officer, whose duty it is to prevent robbery, abets the commission of robbery. Here, though the robbery be not \\n\\ncommitted, A is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for that offence, and also to fine. \\n\\n(d) B abets the commission of a robbery by A, a police-officer, whose duty it is to prevent that offence. Here, though the \\nrobbery be not committed, B is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for the offence of robbery, and also \\nto fine. \\n\\n117. Abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than ten persons.—Whoever abets \\nthe commission of an offence by the public generally or by any number or class of persons exceeding ten, \\nshall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or \\nwith fine, or with both. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA affixes in a public place a placard instigating a sect consisting of more than ten members to meet at a certain time and place, \\nfor the purpose of attacking the members of an adverse sect, while engaged in a procession. A has committed the offence defined \\nin this section. \\n\\n118.  Concealing  design  to  commit  offence  punishable  with  death  or  imprisonment  for  life.—\\nWhoever intending to facilitate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby facilitate the commission of \\nan offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). \\n\\n \\n\\n33 \\n\\n\\x0cvoluntarily  conceals  by  any  act  or  illegal  omission,  or  by  the  use  of  encryption  or  any  other \\ninformation hiding tool, the existence of a design to commit such offence or makes any representation \\nwhich he knows to be false respecting such design, \\n\\nif  offence  be  committed;  if  offence  be  not  committed.—shall,  if  that  offence  be  committed,  be \\npunished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, or, if the \\noffence be not committed, with imprisonment of either description, for a term which may extend to three \\nyears; and in either case shall also be liable to fine. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, knowing that dacoity is about to be committed at B, falsely informs the Magistrate that a dacoity is about to be committed \\nat C, a place in an opposite direction, and thereby misleads the Magistrate with intent to facilitate the commission of the offence. \\nThe dacoity is committed at B in pursuance of the design. A is punishable under this section. \\n\\n119.

Concealing design to commit offence punishable with imprisonment.—Whoever, intending to \\nfacilitate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby facilitate the commission of an offence punishable \\nwith imprisonment, \\n\\nvoluntarily conceals, by any act or illegal omission, the existence of a design to commit such offence, \\n\\nor makes any representation which he knows to be false respecting such design, \\n\\nif  offence  be  committed;  if  offence  be  not  committed.—shall,  if  the  offence  be  committed,  be \\npunished with imprisonment of the description provided for the offence, for a term which may extend to \\none-fourth, and, if the offence be not committed, to one-eight, of the longest term of such imprisonment, or \\nwith such fine as is provided for the offence, or with both. \\n\\nCHAPTER VA \\n\\nCRIMINAL CONSPIRACY \\n\\n120A. Definition of criminal conspiracy.—When two or more persons agree to do, or cause to be \\n\\ndone,— \\n\\n(1) an illegal act, or \\n\\n(2) an act which is not illegal by illegal means, such an agreement is designated a criminal conspiracy: \\n\\n                                                           \\n1.

Culpable homicide.—Whoever causes death by doing an act with the intention of causing death, \\nor with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, or with the knowledge that he \\nis likely by such act to cause death, commits the offence of culpable homicide. \\n\\n(a) A lays sticks and turf over a pit, with the intention of thereby causing death, or with the knowledge that death is likely to \\nbe thereby caused. Z, believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable \\nhomicide. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Ins. by Act 25 of 1927, s. 2. \\n2. Subs. by the A. O. 1950, for “His Majesty’s subjects”. \\n3. Subs. by Act 41 of 1961, s. 3, for certain words. \\n4. Subs. by s. 3, ibid., for “two years”. \\n\\n \\n\\n72 \\n\\n\\x0c(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z\\'s death, \\ninduces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable \\nhomicide. \\n\\n(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. Here, \\nalthough A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause death by \\ndoing an act that he knew was likely to cause death. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, disease \\nor bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused his death. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury shall \\nbe deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment the \\ndeath might have been prevented. \\n\\nExplanation 3.—The causing of the death of a child in the mother\\'s womb is not homicide. But it may \\namount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought \\nforth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born. \\n\\n300. Murder.—Except in the cases hereinafter excepted, culpable homicide is murder, if the act by \\n\\nwhich the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or— \\n\\n2ndly.—If it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely \\n\\nto cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused, or— \\n\\n3rdly.—If  it  is  done  with the  intention  of  causing  bodily  injury  to  any  person  and  the  bodily  injury \\n\\nintended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or— \\n\\n4thly.—If the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous that it must, in all \\nprobability, cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and commits such act without any \\nexcuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A shoots Z with the intention of killing him. Z dies in consequence. A commits murder. \\n\\n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention \\nof causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient \\nin the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring \\nunder any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here \\nA, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury \\nas in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. \\n\\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. \\n\\nZ dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z\\'s death. \\n\\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although \\n\\nhe may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. \\n\\nException  1.—When  culpable  homicide  is  not  murder.—Culpable  homicide  is  not  murder  if  the \\noffender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death \\nof the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. \\n\\nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos:— \\n\\nFirst.—That the  provocation  is  not  sought  or  voluntarily  provoked  by  the offender as an  excuse for \\n\\nkilling or doing harm to any person. \\n\\nSecondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public \\n\\nservant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. \\n\\nThirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private \\n\\ndefence. \\n\\n \\n\\n73 \\n\\n\\x0cExplanation.—Whether  the  provocation  was  grave  and  sudden  enough  to  prevent  the  offence  from \\n\\namounting to murder is a question of fact. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z\\'s child. This is murder, \\ninasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in \\ndoing an act caused by the provocation. \\n\\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing \\nhimself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable \\nhomicide. \\n\\n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, \\n\\ninasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. \\n\\n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A\\'s deposition, and that A has \\n\\nperjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. \\n\\n(e)A attempts to pull Z\\'s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. \\nA is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by \\na thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. \\n\\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B\\'s rage, and to \\ncause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B\\'s hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable \\nhomicide, but A is guilty of murder. \\n\\nException 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the right \\nof private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of \\nthe person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any \\nintention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. \\nA  believing  in  good  faith  that  he  can  by  no  other  means  prevent  himself  from  being  horsewhipped,  shoots  Z  dead.  A  has  not \\ncommitted murder, but only culpable homicide. \\n\\nException 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public \\nservant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes \\ndeath by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of \\nhis duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused. \\n\\nException 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden \\nfight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender\\'s having taken undue advantage \\nor acted in a cruel or unusual manner. \\n\\nExplanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first \\n\\nassault. \\n\\nException 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above \\n\\nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z\\'s youth, \\n\\nhe was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder. \\n\\n301.  Culpable  homicide  by  causing  death  of  person  other  than  person  whose  death  was \\nintended.—If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, commits \\nculpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither intends nor knows himself \\nto be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of which it \\nwould have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or knew himself to he \\nlikely to cause. \\n\\n \\n\\n74 \\n\\n\\x0c302.  Punishment  for  murder.—Whoever  commits  murder  shall  be  punished  with  death  or \\n\\nimprisonment for life,  and shall also be liable to fine. \\n\\n303.

Force.—A  person  is  said  to  use  force  to  another  if  he  causes  motion,  change  of  motion,  or \\ncessation of motion to that other, or if he causes to any substance such motion, or change of motion, or \\ncessation of motion as brings that substance into contact with any part of that other\\'s body, or with anything \\nwhich that other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so situated that such contact affects that other\\'s \\nsense of feeling: Provided that the person causing the motion, or change of motion, or cessation of motion, \\ncauses that motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion in one of the three ways hereinafter described: \\n\\nFirst.—By his own bodily power. \\n\\nSecondly.—By disposing any substance in such a manner that the motion or change or cessation of \\n\\nmotion takes place without any further act on his part, or on the part of any other person. \\n\\nThirdly.—By inducing any animal to move, to change its motion, or to cease to move. \\n\\n350. Criminal force.—Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person\\'s consent, \\nin order to the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force to cause, or knowing it to \\nbe likely that by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the \\nforce is used, is said to use criminal force to that other. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the \\nstream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is \\nproduced without any other action on any person\\'s part. A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without \\nZ\\'s consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will cause injury, \\nfear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z\\'s horses, and thereby causes them to quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of \\nmotion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z\\'s \\nconsent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of \\nmotion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, \\nwithout Z\\'s consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his own person so as to bring it \\ninto contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z\\'s consent, intending or knowing \\nit to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z\\'s \\nclothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z\\'s clothes or something carried \\nby Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z\\'s clothes, A \\nhas used force to Z, and if he did so without Z\\'s consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force \\nto Z. \\n\\n(f) A intentionally pulls up a Woman\\'s veil. Here  A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does so without her consent \\n\\nintending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her. \\n\\n(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by his own bodily power \\ncauses such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact \\nmust affect Z\\'s sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without Z\\'s consent intending \\nor knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force. \\n\\n(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z\\'s consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses \\n\\ncriminal force to Z. \\n\\n \\n\\n82 \\n\\n\\x0c351. Assault.—Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely \\nthat such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture \\nor preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault. \\n\\nExplanation.—Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give \\nto his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an \\nassault. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike \\n\\nZ. A has committed an assault. \\n\\n(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to \\n\\nbelieve that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A has committed an assault upon Z. \\n\\n(c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, “I will give you a beating”. Here, though the words used by A could in no case amount to \\nan assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault,the gesture \\nexplained by the words may amount to an assault. \\n\\n352. Punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation.—Whoever \\nassaults or uses criminal force to any person otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation given by that \\nperson, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three \\nmonths, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both. \\n\\nExplanation.—Grave and sudden provocation will not mitigate the punishment for an offence under \\nthis  section,  if  the  provocation  is  sought  or  voluntarily  provoked  by  the  offender  as  an  excuse  for  the \\noffence, or \\n\\nif the provocation is given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant, in the \\n\\nlawful exercise of the powers of such public servant, or \\n\\nif the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. \\n\\n Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate the offence, is a question of fact. \\n\\n353.  Assault  or  criminal  force  to  deter  public  servant  from  discharge  of  his  duty.—Whoever \\nassaults or uses criminal force to any person being a public servant in the execution of his duty as such \\npublic servant, or with intent to prevent or deter that person from discharging his duty as such public servant, \\nor in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by such person to the lawful discharge of his \\nduty as such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which \\nmay extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. \\n\\nSTATE AMENDMENT \\n\\nAmendment of section 353 of 45 of 1860.—In section 353 of the said Code, for the words “two years” \\n\\nMaharashtra.— \\n\\nthe words “five years” shall be substituted. \\n\\n[Vide Maharashtra Act 40 of 2018, sec. 3] \\n\\n354.

Theft.—Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of \\nany person without that person\\'s consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit \\ntheft. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the \\nsubject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft. \\n\\nExplanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it \\n\\nfrom moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. \\n\\nExplanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, \\n\\nand to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. \\n\\nExplanation 5.—The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be given \\neither by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or \\nimplied. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A cuts down a tree on Z\\'s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent. \\n\\nHere, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft. \\n\\n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z\\'s dog to follow it. Here, if A\\'s intention be dishonestly to take the \\n\\ndog out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z\\'s dog has begun to follow A. \\n\\n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly \\n\\ntake the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. \\n\\n(d) A being Z\\'s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z\\'s plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z\\'s consent. \\n\\nA has committed theft. \\n\\n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith \\nand sells it. Here the plate was not in Z\\'s possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z\\'s possession, and A has not committed \\ntheft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. \\n\\n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z\\'s possession, and if A dishonestly \\n\\nremoves it, A commits theft. \\n\\ncommit criminal misappropriation of property. \\n\\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may \\n\\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z\\'s house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear \\nof search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention \\nof taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first  moving the ring, \\ncommits theft. \\n\\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for \\nwhich the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z\\'s hand, \\nand carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as \\nwhat he did was not done dishonestly.  \\n\\n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the \\nwatch out of Z\\'s possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch \\nas he takes it dishonestly. \\n\\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent, not having paid what he \\n\\nborrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \\n\\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains \\n\\nmoney from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. \\n\\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z\\'s library in Z\\'s absence, and takes away a book without Z\\'s express consent \\nfor the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he \\nhad Z\\'s implied consent to use Z\\'s book. If this was A\\'s impression, A has not committed theft. \\n\\n(n) A asks charity from Z\\'s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is \\nprobable that A may conceive that Z\\'s wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A\\'s impression, A has not committed theft. \\n\\n(o) A is the paramour of Z\\'s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such \\n\\nproperty as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. \\n\\n \\n\\n95 \\n\\n\\x0c(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A\\'s own property, takes that property out of B\\'s possession. Here, \\n\\nas A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. \\n\\n379.

Robbery.—In all robbery there is either theft or extortion. \\n\\nOf Robbery and Dacoity \\n\\nWhen theft is robbery.—Theft is “robbery” if, in order to the committing of the theft, or in committing \\nthe theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft, the offender, for \\nthat end voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint, or fear of \\ninstant death or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint. \\n\\nWhen extortion is robbery.—Extortion is  “robbery” if the offender, at the time of committing the \\nextortion, is in the presence of the person put in fear, and commits the extortion by putting that person in \\nfear of instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint to that person or to some other person, \\nand, by so putting in fear, induces the person so put in fear then and there to deliver up the thing extorted. \\n\\nExplanation.—The offender is said to be present if he is sufficiently near to put the other person in fear \\n\\nof instant death, of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A holds Z down, and fraudulently takes Z\\'s money and jewels from Z\\'s clothes, without Z\\'s consent. Here A has committed \\ntheft,  and,  in  order  to  the  committing  of  that  theft,  has  voluntarily  caused  wrongful  restraint  to  Z.  A  has  therefore  committed \\nrobbery. \\n\\n(b) A meets Z on the high road, shows a pistol, and demands Z\\'s purse. Z, in consequence, surrenders his purse. Here A has \\nextorted the purse from Z by putting him in fear of instant hurt, and being at the time of committing the extortion in his presence. \\nA has therefore committed robbery. \\n\\n(c) A meets Z and Z\\'s child on the high road. A takes the child, and threatens to filing it down a precipice, unless Z delivers \\nhis purse. Z, in consequence, delivers his purse. Here A has extorted the purse from Z, by causing Z to be in fear of instant hurt to \\nthe child who is there present. A has therefore committed robbery on Z. \\n\\n(d) A obtains property from Z by saying “Your child is in the hands of my gang, and will be put to death unless you send us \\nten thousand rupees”. This is extortion, and punishable as such: but it is not robbery, unless Z is put in fear of the instant death of \\nhis child. \\n\\n391. Dacoity.—When five or more persons conjointly commit or attempt to commit a robbery, or where \\nthe whole number of persons conjointly committing or attempting to commit a robbery, and persons present \\n\\n                                                           \\n1.Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). \\n\\n \\n\\n98 \\n\\n\\x0cand aiding such commission or attempt, amount to five or more, every person so committing, attempting or \\naiding, is said to commit “dacoity”. \\n\\n392.  Punishment  for  robbery.—Whoever  commits  robbery  shall  be  punished  with  rigorous \\nimprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine; and, if the robbery \\nbe committed on the highway between sunset and sunrise, the imprisonment may be extended to fourteen \\nyears. \\n\\n393.

Dishonest misappropriation of property.—Whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to \\nhis own use any movable property, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term \\nwhich may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). \\n\\n \\n\\n99 \\n\\n\\x0cIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A takes property belonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession, in good faith believing at the time when he takes it, that the property \\nbelongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own \\nuse, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\n(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z\\'s library in Z\\'s absence, and takes away a book without Z\\'s express consent. \\nHere, if  A  was under the impression that he had Z\\'s implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has not \\ncommitted theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\n(c) A and B, being, joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B\\'s possession, intending to use it. Here, as A has a right \\nto use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it. But, if A sells the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his own \\nuse, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation with the meaning \\n\\nof this section. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement. A, knowing that the note belongs to Z, \\npledges it with a banker as a security or a loan, intending at a future time to restore it to Z. A has committed an offence under this \\nsection. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—A person who finds property not in the possession of any other person, and takes such \\nproperty for the purpose of protecting it for, or of restoring it to, the owner, does not take or misappropriate \\nit dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he is guilty of the offence above defined, if he appropriates \\nit  to  his  own  use,  when  he  knows  or  has  the  means  of  discovering  the  owner,  or  before  he  has  used \\nreasonable means to discover and give notice to the owner and has kept the property a reasonable time to \\nenable the owner to claim it. \\n\\nWhat are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question of fact. \\n\\nIt is not necessary that the finder should know who is the owner of the property, or that any particular \\nperson is the owner of it; it is sufficient if, at the time of appropriating it, he does not believe it to be his \\nown property, or in good faith believe that the real owner cannot be found. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A finds a rupee on the high road, not knowing to whom the rupee belongs, A picks up the rupee. Here A has not committed \\n\\nthe offence defined in this section. \\n\\n(b) A finds a letter on the road, containing a bank note. From the direction and contents of the letter he learns to whom the \\n\\nnote belongs. He appropriates the note. He is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\n(c) A finds a cheque payable to bearer. He can form no conjecture as to the person who has lost the cheque. But the name of \\nthe person, who has drawn the cheque, appears. A knows that this person can direct him to the person in whose favour the cheque \\nwas drawn. A appropriates the cheque without attempting to discover the owner. He is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\n(d) A sees Z drop his purse with  money in it. A picks up the purse  with the intention of restoring it to Z, but afterwards \\n\\nappropriates it to his own use. A has committed an offence under this section. \\n\\n(e) A finds a purse with money, not knowing to whom it belongs; he afterwards discovers that it belongs to Z, and appropriates \\n\\nit to his own use. A is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\n(f) A finds a valuable ring, not knowing to whom it belongs. A sells it immediately without attempting to discover the owner. \\n\\nA is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\n404.  Dishonest  misappropriation  of  property  possessed  by  deceased  person  at  the  time  of  his \\ndeath.—Whoever  dishonestly  misappropriates  or  converts  to  his  own  use  property,  knowing  that  such \\nproperty was in the possession of a deceased person at the time of that person\\'s decease, and has not since \\nbeen  in  the  possession  of  any  person  legally  entitled  to  such  possession,  shall  be  punished  with \\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to \\nfine, and if the offender at the time of such person\\'s decease was employed by him as a clerk or servant, the \\nimprisonment may extend to seven years. \\n\\nZ dies in possession of furniture and money. His servant A, before the money comes into the possession of any person entitled \\n\\nto such possession, dishonestly misappropriates it. A has committed the offence defined in this section. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\n100 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cOf Criminal Breach of Trust \\n\\n405. Criminal breach of trust.—Whoever, being in any manner entrusted with property, or with any \\ndominion  over  property,  dishonestly  misappropriates  or  converts  to  his  own  use  that  property,  or \\ndishonestly uses or disposes of that property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in \\nwhich  such  trust  is  to  be  discharged,  or  of  any  legal  contract,  express  or  implied,  which  he  has  made \\ntouching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do, commits “criminal breach \\nof trust”. \\n\\nExplanation  1.—A  person,  being  an  employer  of  an  establishment  whether  exempted  under \\nsection 17 of the Employees’ Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 (19 of 1952) or not \\nwho deducts the employee’s contribution from the wages payable to the employee for credit to a Provident \\nFund or Family Pension Fund established by any law for the time being in force, shall be deemed to have \\nbeen  entrusted  with  the  amount  of  the  contribution  so  deducted  by  him  and  if  he  makes  default  in  the \\npayment  of  such  contribution  to  the  said  Fund  in  violation  of  the  said  law,  shall  be  deemed  to  have \\ndishonestly used the amount of the said contribution in violation of a direction of law as aforesaid.] \\n\\nExplanation 2.—A person, being an employer, who deducts the employees’ contribution from the \\nwages payable to the employee for credit to the Employees’ State Insurance Fund held and administered \\nby the Employees’ State Insurance Corporation established under the Employees’ State Insurance Act, 1948 \\n(34 of 1948), shall be deemed to have been entrusted with the amount of the contribution so deducted by \\nhim and if he makes default in the payment of such contribution to the said Fund in violation of the said \\nAct, shall be deemed to have dishonestly used the amount of the said contribution in violation of a direction \\nof law as aforesaid. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, being executor to the will of a deceased person, dishonestly disobeys the law which directs him to divide the effects \\n\\naccording to the will, and appropriates them to his own use. A has committed criminal breach of trust. \\n\\n(b) A is a warehouse-keeper. Z going on a journey, entrusts his furniture to A, under a contract that it shall be returned on \\n\\npayment of a stipulated sum for warehouse room. A dishonestly sells the goods.

There is an express or implied contract between A and Z, that all \\nsums remitted by Z to A shall be invested by A, according to Z\\'s direction. Z remits a lakh of rupees to A, with directions to A to \\ninvest the same in Company\\'s paper. A dishonestly disobeys the directions and employs the money in his own business. A has \\ncommitted criminal breach of trust. \\n\\n(d) But if A, in the last illustration, not dishonestly but in good faith, believing that it will be more for Z\\'s advantage to hold \\nshares in the Bank of Bengal, disobeys Z\\'s directions, and buys shares in the Bank of Bengal, for Z, instead of buying Company\\'s \\npaper, here, thought Z should suffer loss, and should be entitled to bring a civil action against A, on account of that loss, yet A, not \\nhaving acted dishonestly, has not committed criminal breach of trust. \\n\\n(e)  A,  a revenue-officer,  is entrusted  with public  money  and is  either directed by  law, or  bound by  a  contract,  express  or \\nimplied, with the Government, to pay into a certain treasury all the public money which he holds. A dishonestly appropriates the \\nmoney. A has committed criminal breach of trust. \\n\\n(f) A, a carrier, is entrusted by Z with property to be carried by land or by water. A dishonestly misappropriates the property. \\n\\nA has committed criminal breach of trust. \\n\\n406.

Making  a  false  document.—A  person  is  said  to  make  a  false  document  or  false  electronic \\n\\nrecord— \\n\\nFirst.—Who dishonestly or fraudulently— \\n\\n(a) makes, signs, seals or executes a document or part of a document; \\n(b) makes or transmits any electronic record or part of any electronic record; \\n(c) affixes any electronic signature on any electronic record; \\n(d) makes any mark denoting the execution of a document or the authenticity of the electronic \\n\\nsignature, \\n\\nwith the intention of causing it to be believed that such document or part of document, electronic record \\nor electronic signature was made, signed, sealed, executed, transmitted or affixed by or by the authority \\nof a person by whom or by whose authority he knows that it was not made, singed, sealed, executed or \\naffixed; or \\n\\nSecondly.—Who without lawful authority, dishonestly or fraudulently, by cancellation or otherwise, \\nalters a document or an electronic record in any material part thereof, after it has been made, executed or \\naffixed with electronic signature either by himself or by any other person, whether such person be living \\nor dead at the time of such alteration; or \\n\\nThirdly.—Who dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, seal, execute or alter a document \\nor an electronic record or to affix his  electronic signature on any electronic record knowing that such \\nperson by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication cannot, or that by reason of deception practised \\nupon him, he does not know the contents of the document or electronic record or the nature of the alteration.] \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A has a letter of credit upon B for rupees 10,000, written by Z. A, in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum \\n\\n1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.  \\n\\n(b) A, without Z\\'s authority, affixes Z\\'s seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling \\n\\nthe estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently \\n\\nfills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery. \\n\\n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable and authorizes B to fill up the cheque \\nby inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting \\nthe sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery. \\n\\n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B\\'s authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and \\nintending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the \\nsecurity of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery. \\n\\n(f) Z\\'s will contains these words—“I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B and C.” A dishonestly scratches \\n\\nout B\\'s name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. The words “TRADE OR” omitted by Act 43 of 1958, s. 135 and Sch. (w.e.f. 25-11-1959). \\n2. Subs. by Act 21 of 2000, s. 91 and the First Sch., for certain words (w.e.f. 17-10-2000). \\n3. Subs. by Act 10 of 2009, s. 51, for “digital signature” (w.e.f. 27-10-2009). \\n\\n \\n\\n109 \\n\\n\\x0c(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words “Pay to Z or his order” \\nand signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank \\nendorsement. B commits forgery. \\n\\n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated \\nsix months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. \\nA has committed forgery. \\n\\n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will \\n\\naccording to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B\\'s name without B\\'s authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances \\nfrom unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order \\nto induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(k) A without B\\'s authority writes a letter and signs it in B\\'s name certifying to A\\'s character, intending thereby to obtain employment under \\nZ. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or \\nimplied contract for service. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. \\n\\nA has committed forgery. \\n\\n(b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z\\'s name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of \\nexchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws \\nthe bill upon the paper pursuant to A\\'s intention, B is also guilty of forgery. \\n\\n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending \\n\\nto cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of \\nthe estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it \\nto be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it. \\n\\n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A\\'s benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to give \\na colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it \\nmay be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictious person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by \\na real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount \\nto forgery. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it. \\nA commits forgery. \\n\\nExplanation 3.—For the purposes of this section, the expression “affixing electronic signature” shall have the \\nmeaning assigned to it in clause (d) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (21 of \\n2000).] \\n\\n465.

A and B, \\nintending  to  cause  Z\\'s  death,  knowingly  co-operate  in  causing  that  effect  by  illegally  omitting,  each  during  the  time  of  his \\nattendance, to furnish Z with food supplied to them for that purpose.

A,  intending  to  cause  Z\\'s  death,  illegally  omits  to  supply  Z  with  food;  in \\nconsequence of which Z is much reduced in strength, but the starvation is not sufficient to cause his death. A is dismissed from his \\noffice, and B succeeds him. B, without collusion or co-operation with A, illegally omits to supply Z with food, knowing that he is \\nlikely thereby to cause Z\\'s death. Z dies of hunger. B is guilty of murder, but, as A did not co-operate with B. A is guilty only of \\nan attempt to commit murder. \\n\\n38. Persons concerned in criminal act may be guilty of different offences.—Where several persons \\nare engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different offences by \\nmeans of that act. \\n\\nA  attacks  Z  under  such  circumstances  of  grave  provocation  that  his  killing  of  Z  would  be  only  culpable  homicide  not \\namounting to murder. B, having ill-will towards Z and intending to kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, assists \\nA in killing Z. Here, though A and B are both engaged in causing Z\\'s death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable \\nhomicide. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\n19 \\n\\n                                                           \\n1.

Here, A may not have intended to cause death; and may even be sorry that death has been caused by his act; yet, if he \\nknew that he was likely to cause death, he has caused death voluntarily. \\n\\n40. “Offence”.—Except in the Chapters and sections mentioned in clauses 2 and 3 of this section, \\n\\nthe word “offence” denotes a thing made punishable by this Code. \\n\\nIn Chapter IV, Chapter VA and in the following sections, namely, sections 64, 65, 66, 67, 71], \\n109, 110, 112, 114, 115, 116, 117,118, 119 and 120 187, 194, 195, 203, 211, 213, 214, 221, 222, 223, \\n224,225,  327,  328,  329,  330,  331,  347,  348,  388,  389  and  445,  the  word  “offence”  denotes  a  thing \\npunishable under this Code, or under any special or local law as hereinafter defined. \\n\\nAnd in sections 141, 176, 177, 201, 202, 212, 216 and 441, the word “offence” has the same meaning \\nwhen the thing punishable under the special or local law is punishable under such law with imprisonment \\nfor a term of six months or upwards, whether with or without fine.]  \\n\\n41. “Special law”.—A “special law” is a law applicable to a particular subject. \\n\\n42. “Local law”.—A “local law” is a law applicable only to a particular part of India]. \\n\\n43. “Illegal”. “Legally bound to do”.—The word  “illegal” is applicable to everything which is an \\noffence or which is prohibited by law, or which furnishes ground for a civil action; and a person is said to \\nbe “legally bound to do” whatever it is illegal in him to omit. \\n\\n44. “Injury”.—The word “injury” denotes any harm whatever illegally caused to any person, in body, \\n\\nmind, reputation or property. \\n\\n45. “Life”.—The word “life” denotes the life of a human being, unless the contrary appears from the \\n\\n46. “Death”.—The word “death” denotes the death of a human being unless the contrary appears from \\n\\ncontext. \\n\\nthe context. \\n\\n47. “Animal”.—The word “animal” denotes any living creature, other than a human being. \\n\\n48.  “Vessel”.—The  word  “vessel”  denotes  anything  made  for  the  conveyance  by  water  of  human \\n\\nbeings or of property. \\n\\n49. “Year”. “Month”.—Wherever the word “year” or the word “month” is used, it is to be understood \\n\\nthat the year or the month is to be reckoned according to the British calendar. \\n\\n50. “Section”.—The word “section” denotes one of those portions of a Chapter of this Code which are \\n\\ndistinguished by prefixed numeral figures. \\n\\n51. “Oath”.—The word “oath” includes a solemn affirmation substituted by law for an oath, and any \\ndeclaration required or authorised by law to be made before a public servant or to be used for the purpose \\nof proof, whether in a Court of Justice or not. \\n\\n52. “Good faith”.—Nothing is said to be done or believed in “good faith” which is done or believed \\n\\nwithout due care and attention. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1.

Here, if seventy-five \\nrupees of the fine be paid or levied before the expiration of one month of the imprisonment, A will be discharged as soon as the \\nfirst month has expired. If seventy-five rupees be paid or levied at the time of the expiration of the first month, or at any later time \\nwhile  A  continues  in  imprisonment,  A  will  be  immediately  discharged.  If  fifty  rupees  of  the  fine  be  paid or  levied  before  the \\nexpiration of two months of the imprisonment. A will be discharged as soon as the two months are completed.

Limit  of  punishment  of  offence  made  up  of  several  offences.—Where  anything  which  is  an \\noffence is made up of parts, any of which parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished with \\nthe punishment of more than one of such his offences, unless it be so expressly provided. \\n\\nWhere anything is an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law in force for \\n\\nthe time being by which offences are defined or punished, or \\n\\nwhere several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves constitute an offence, \\n\\nconstitute, when combined, a different offence, \\n\\nthe offender shall not be punished with a more severe punishment than the Court which tries him could \\n\\naward for any one of such offences. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A gives Z fifty strokes with a stick. Here A may have committed the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to Z by the whole \\nbeating, and also by each of the blows which make up the whole beating. If A were liable to punishment for every blow, he might \\nbe imprisoned for fifty years, one for each blow. But he is liable only to one punishment for the whole beating. \\n\\n(b) But, if, while A is beating Z, Y interferes, and A intentionally strikes Y, here, as the blow given to Y is no part of the act \\nwhereby A voluntarily causes hurt to Z, A is liable to one punishment for voluntarily causing hurt to Z, and to another for the blow \\ngiven to Y. \\n\\n72. Punishment of person guilty of one of several offences, the judgment stating that it is doubtful \\nof  which.—In  all  cases  in  which  judgment  is  given  that  a  person  is  guilty  of  one  of  several  offences \\nspecified in the judgment, but that it is doubtful of which of these offences he is guilty, the offender shall \\nbe punished for the offence for which the lowest punishment is provided if the same punishment is not \\nprovided for all. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Ins. by Act 8 of 1882, s. 3. \\n2. Added by s. 4, ibid. \\n\\n \\n\\n23 \\n\\n\\x0c73. Solitary confinement.—Whenever any person is convicted of an offence for which under this Code \\nthe Court has power to sentence him to rigorous imprisonment, the Court may, by its sentence, order that \\nthe offender shall be kept in solitary confinement for any portion or portions of the imprisonment to which \\nhe is sentenced, not exceeding three months in the whole, according to the following scale, that is to say— \\n\\na time not exceeding one month if the term of imprisonment shall not exceed six months; \\n\\na time not exceeding two months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed six months andshall not \\n\\nexceed one year \\n\\na time not exceeding three months if the term of imprisonment shall exceed one year. \\n\\n74.  Limit  of  solitary  confinement.—In  executing  a  sentence  of  solitary  confinement,  such \\nconfinement shall in no case exceed fourteen days at a time, with intervals between the periods of solitary \\nconfinement of not less duration than such periods; and when the imprisonment awarded shall exceed three \\nmonths, the solitary confinement shall not exceed seven days in any one month of the whole imprisonment \\nawarded, with intervals between the periods of solitary confinement of not less duration than such periods. \\n\\n75.  Enhanced  punishment  for  certain  offences  under  Chapter  XII  or  Chapter  XVII  after \\n\\nprevious conviction.—Whoever, having been convicted,— \\n\\n(a) by a Court in India, of an offence punishable under Chapter XII or Chapter XVII of this Code \\n\\nwith imprisonment of either description for a term of three years or upwards, shall be guilty of any offence punishable under either of those Chapters with like imprisonment for the like \\nterm, shall be subject for every such subsequent offence to imprisonment for life, or to imprisonment of \\neither description for a term which may extend to ten years.] \\n\\nCHAPTER IV \\n\\nGENERAL EXCEPTIONS \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n76. Act done by a person bound, or by mistake of fact believing himself bound, by law.—Nothing \\nis an offence which is done by a person who is, or who by reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of \\na mistake of law in good faith believes himself to be, bound by law to do it. \\n\\n(a)  A,  a  soldier,  fires  on  a  mob by  the  order  of  his  superior  officer,  in  conformity  with  the  commands  of  the  law.  A  has \\n\\ncommitted no offence. \\n\\narrests Z. A has committed no offence. \\n\\n(b) A, an officer of a Court of Justice, being ordered by that Court to arrest Y, and after due enquiry, believing Z to be Y, \\n\\n77.  Act  of  Judge when  acting judicially.—Nothing  is  an offence  which  is  done  by  a  Judge  when \\nacting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which in good faith he believes to be, given to \\nhim by law. \\n\\n78. Act done pursuant to the judgment or order of Court.—Nothing which is done in pursuance of, \\nor which is warranted by the judgment or order of, a Court of Justice; if done whilst such judgment or order \\nremains  in  force,  is  an  offence,  notwithstanding  the  Court  may  have  had  no  jurisdiction  to  pass  such \\njudgment  or  order,  provided  the  person  doing  the  act  in  good  faith  believes  that  the  Court  had  such \\njurisdiction. \\n\\n79. Act done by a person justified, or by mistake of fact believing himself, justified, by law.—\\nNothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Subs. by Act 8 of 1862, s. 5, for “be less than a”. \\n2. Subs. by Act 3 of 1910, s. 2, for section 75. \\n3. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A. O. 1948, the A. O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch., \\n\\nto read as above. \\n\\n4. The word “or” omitted by Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch. \\n5. Cl. (b) omitted by s. 3 and the Sch., ibid. \\n6. Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). \\n\\n \\n\\n24 \\n\\n\\x0cof fact and not by reason of a mistake of law in good faith, believes himself to be justified by law, in doing \\nit. \\n\\nA sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, of the \\npower which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in the fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper \\nauthorities. A has committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in self-defence. \\n\\n80. Accident in doing a lawful act.—Nothing is an offence which is done by accident or misfortune, \\nand without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act in a lawful manner by lawful \\nmeans and with proper care and caution. \\n\\nA is at work with a hatchet; the head flies off and kills a man who is standing by. Here, if there was no want of proper caution \\n\\non the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence. \\n\\n81.  Act  likely  to  cause  harm,  but  done without  criminal intent,  and  to  prevent  other  harm.—\\nNothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause harm, \\nif it be done without any criminal intention to cause harm, and in good faith for the purpose of preventing \\nor avoiding other harm to person or property. \\n\\nExplanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was \\nof such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that it \\nwas likely to cause harm. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly, and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a position \\nthat, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless  he \\nchanges the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with only two \\npassengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in \\ngood faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run \\ndown the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger \\nwhich he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down C. \\n\\n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention \\nin good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so \\nimminent as to excuse A\\'s act, A is not guilty of the offence. \\n\\n82. Act of a child under seven years of age.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a child under \\n\\nseven years of age.  \\n\\n83.  Act  of  a  child  above  seven  and  under  twelve  of  immature  understanding.—Nothing  is  an \\noffence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under twelve, who has not attained sufficient \\nmaturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion. \\n\\n84. Act of a person of unsound mind.—Nothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the \\ntime of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he \\nis doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. \\n\\n85. Act of a person incapable of judgment by reason of intoxication caused against his will.—\\nNothing is an offence which is done by a person who, at the time of doing it, is, by reason of intoxication, \\nincapable  of  knowing  the  nature  of  the  act,  or  that  he  is  doing  what  is  either  wrong,  or  contrary  to  \\nlaw;  provided  that  the  thing  which  intoxicated  him  was  administered  to  him  without  his  knowledge  or \\nagainst his will. \\n\\n86. Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.—In \\ncases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person who \\ndoes the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge as he \\nwould have had if he had not been intoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was administered to \\nhim without his knowledge or against his will. \\n\\n87.  Act  not  intended  and  not  known  to  be  likely  to  cause  death  or  grievous  hurt,  done  by \\nconsent.—Nothing which is not intended to cause death, or grievous hurt, and which is not known by the \\ndoer to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, \\nor be intended by the doer to cause, to any person, above eighteen years of age, who has given consent, \\n\\n \\n\\n25 \\n\\n\\x0cwhether express or implied, to suffer that harm; or by reason of any harm which it may be known by the \\ndoer to be likely to cause to any such person who has consented to take the risk of that harm. \\n\\nA and Z agree to fence with each other for amusement. This agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which, \\n\\nin the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence. \\n\\n88. Act not intended to cause death, done by consent in good faith for person\\'s benefit.—Nothing, \\nwhich is not intented to cause death, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended \\nby the doer to cause, or be known by the doer to be likely to cause, to any person for whose benefit it is \\ndone in good faith, and who has given a consent, whether express or implied, to suffer that harm, or to take \\nthe risk of that harm. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, a surgeon, knowing that a particular operation is likely to cause the death of Z, who suffers under the painful complaint, \\nbut not intending to cause Z\\'s death, and intending, in good faith, Z\\'s benefit, performs that operation on Z, with Z\\'s consent. A has \\ncommitted no offence. \\n\\n89. Act done in good faith for benefit of child or insane person, by or by consent of guardian.—\\nNothing which is done in good faith for the benefit of a person under twelve years of age, or of unsound \\nmind, by or by consent, either express or implied, of the guardian or other person having lawful charge of \\nthat person, is an offence by reason of any harm which it may cause, or be intended by the doer to cause or \\nbe known by the doer to be likely to cause to that person: Provided— \\n\\nProvisos. First.—That this exception shall not extend to the intentional causing of death, or to the \\n\\nattempting to cause death; \\n\\nSecondly.—That this exception shall not extend to the doing of anything which the person doing it \\nknows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, \\nor the curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\n\\nThirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of grievous hurt, or to the \\nattempting to cause grievous hurt, unless it be for the purpose of preventing death or grievous hurt, or \\nthe curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\n\\nFourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing \\n\\nof which offence it would not extend. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, in good faith, for his child\\'s benefit without his child\\'s consent, has his child cut for the stone by a surgeon knowing it to \\nbe likely that the operation will cause the child\\'s death, but not intending to cause the child\\'s death. A is within the exception,  \\ninasmuch as his object was the cure of the child. \\n\\n90. Consent known to be given under fear or misconception.—A consent is not such a consent as is \\nintended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a \\nmisconception of fact, and if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent was \\ngiven in consequence of such fear or misconception; or \\n\\nConsent of insane person.—if the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or \\n\\nintoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or \\n\\nConsent of child.—unless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person \\n\\nwho is under twelve years of age. \\n\\n91. Exclusion of acts which are offences independently of harm cause.—The exceptions in sections \\n87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they may cause, \\nor be intended to cause, or be known to be likely to cause, to the person giving the consent, or on whose \\nbehalf the consent is given. \\n\\nCausing miscarriage (unless caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman) is offence independently of \\nany harm which it may cause or be intended to cause to the woman. Therefore, it is not an offence “by reason of such harm”; and \\nthe consent of the woman or of her guardian to the causing of such miscarriage does not justify the act. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\n26 \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c92. Act done in good faith for benefit of a person without consent.—Nothing is an offence by reason \\nof any harm which it may cause to a person for whose benefit it is done in good faith, even without that \\nperson\\'s consent, if the circumstances are such that it is impossible for that person to signify consent, or if \\nthat person is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian or other person in lawful charge of him from \\nwhom it is possible to obtain consent in time for the thing to be done with benefit: Provided— \\n\\nProvisos.  First.—That  this  exception  shall  not  extend  to  the  intentional  causing  of  death,  or  the \\n\\nattempting to cause death; \\n\\nSecondly.—That this exception shall not extend  to the doing of anything which the person doing it \\nknows to be likely to cause death, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or grievous hurt, or \\nthe curing of any grievous disease or infirmity; \\n\\nThirdly.—That this exception shall not extend to the voluntary causing of hurt, or to the attempting to \\n\\ncause hurt, for any purpose other than the preventing of death or hurt; \\n\\nFourthly.—That this exception shall not extend to the abetment of any offence, to the committing of \\n\\nwhich offence it would not extend. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) Z is thrown from his horse, and is insensible. A, a surgeon, finds that Z requires to be trepanned. A, not intending Z\\'s death, \\nbut in good faith, for Z\\'s benefit, performs the trepan before Z recovers his power of judging for himself. A has committed no \\noffence. \\n\\n(b) Z is carried off by a tiger. A fires at the tiger knowing it to be likely that the shot may kill Z, but not intending to kill Z, \\n\\nand in good faith intending Z\\'s benefit. A\\'s ball gives Z a mortal wound. A has committed no offence. \\n\\n(c) A, a surgeon, sees a child suffer an accident which is likely to prove fatal unless an operation be immediately performed. \\nThere is not time to apply to the child\\'s guardian. A performs the operation in spite of the entreaties of the child, intending, in good \\nfaith, the child\\'s benefit. A has committed no offence. \\n\\n(d) A is in a house which is on fire, with Z, a child. People below hold out a blanket. A drops the child from the house stop, \\nknowing it to be likely that the fall may kill the child, but not intending to kill the child, and intending, in good faith, the child\\'s \\nbenefit. Here, even if the child is killed by the fall, A has committed no offence. \\n\\nExplanation.—Mere pecuniary benefit is not benefit within the meaning of sections 88, 89 and 92. \\n\\n93. Communication made in good faith.—No communication made in good faith is an offence by \\n\\nreason of any harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is made for the benefit of that person. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, a surgeon, in good faith, communicates to a patient his opinion that he cannot live. The patient dies in consequence of the \\n\\nshock. A has committed no offence, though he knew it to be likely that the communication might cause the patient\\'s death. \\n\\n94. Act to which a person is compelled by threats.—Except murder, and offences against the State \\npunishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, \\nwhich,  at  the  time  of  doing  it,  reasonably  cause  the  apprehension  that  instant  death  to  that  person  will \\notherwise  be  the  consequence:  Provided  the  person  doing  the  act  did  not  of  his  own  accord,  or  from  a \\nreasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which \\nhe became subject to such constraint. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A person who, of his own accord, or by reason of a threat of being beaten, joins a gang \\nof dacoits, knowing their character, is not entitled to the benefit of this exception, on the ground of his \\nhaving been compelled by his associates to do anything that is an offence by law. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—A person seized by a gang of dacoits, and forced, by threat of instant death, to do a \\nthing which is an offence by law; for example, a smith compelled to take his tools and to force the door of \\na house for the dacoits to enter and plunder it, is entitled to the benefit of this exception. \\n\\n95. Act causing slight harm.—Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to \\ncause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of ordinary \\nsense and temper would complain of such harm. \\n\\n96. Things done in private defence.—Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right \\n\\n \\nOf the Right of Private Defence \\n\\n27 \\n\\nof private defence. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c97. Right of private defence of the body and of property.—Every person has a right, subject to the \\n\\nrestrictions contained in section 99, to defend— \\n\\nFirst.—His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human body; \\n\\nSecondly.—The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against \\nany act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or \\nwhich is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass. \\n\\n98. Right of private defence against the act of a person of unsound mind, etc.—When an act, which \\nwould otherwise be a certain offence, is not that offence, by reason of the youth, the want of maturity of \\nunderstanding, the unsoundness of mind or the intoxication of the person doing that act, or by reason of any \\nmisconception on the part of that person, every person has the same right of private defence against that act \\nwhich he would have if the act were that offence. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) Z, under the influence of madness, attempts to kill A; Z is guilty of no offence. But A has the same right of private defence \\n\\nwhich he would have if Z were sane. \\n\\n(b) A enters by night a house which he is legally entitled to enter. Z, in good faith, taking A for a house-breaker, attacks A. \\nHere Z, by attacking A under this misconception, commits no offence. But A has the same right of private defence against Z, which \\nhe would have if Z were not acting under that misconception. \\n\\n99. Acts against which there is no right of private defence.—There is no right of private defence \\nagainst an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or \\nattempted to be done, by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that act, \\nmay not be strictly justifiable by law. \\n\\nThere is no right of private defence against an act which does not reasonably cause the apprehension \\nof death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant acting in \\ngood faith under colour of his office, though that direction may not be strictly justifiable by law. \\n\\nThere is no right of private defence in cases in which there is time to have recourse to protection of the \\n\\npublic authorities. \\n\\nExtent to which the right may be exercised.—The right of private defence in no case extends to the \\n\\ninflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence. \\n\\nExplanation  1.—A  person  is  not  deprived  of  the  right  of  private  defence  against  an  act  done,  or \\nattempted to be done, by a public servant, as such, unless he knows or has reason to believe, that the person \\ndoing the act is such public servant. \\n\\nExplanation  2.—A  person  is  not  deprived  of  the  right  of  private  defence  against  an  act  done,  or \\nattempted to be done, by the direction of a public servant, unless he knows, or has reason to believe, that \\nthe person doing the act is acting by such direction, or unless such person states the authority under which \\nhe acts, or if he has authority in writing, unless he produces such authority, if demanded. \\n\\n100. When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death.—The right of private \\ndefence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section, to the voluntary \\ncausing of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the offence which occasions the exercise of the \\nright be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:— \\n\\nFirst.—Such  an  assault  as  may  reasonably  cause  the  apprehension  that  death  will  otherwise  be  the \\n\\nconsequence of such assault; \\n\\nbe the consequence of such assault; \\n\\nSecondly.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise \\n\\nThirdly.—An assault with the intention of committing rape; \\n\\nFourthly.—An assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust; \\n\\nFifthly.—An assault with the intention of kidnapping or abducting; \\n\\nSixthly.—An assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under circumstances which \\nmay reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the public authorities for \\nhis release. \\n\\n \\n\\n28 \\n\\n\\x0cSeventhly.—An act of throwing or administering acid or an attempt to throw or administer acid which \\nmay reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such act. \\n\\n101. When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.—If the offence be not of any \\nof the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, the right of private defence of the body does \\nnot  extend  to  the  voluntary  causing  of  death  to  the  assailant,  but  does  extend,  under  the  restrictions \\nmentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death. \\n\\n102. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body.—The right of \\nprivate defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises \\nfrom an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed; and it \\ncontinues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues. \\n\\n103. When the right of private defence of property extends to causing death.—The right of private \\ndefence of property extends, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the  voluntary causing of \\ndeath or of any other harm to the wrong-doer, if the offence, the committing of which, or the attempting to \\ncommit  which,  occasions  the  exercise  of  the  right,  be  an  offence  of  any  of  the  descriptions  hereinafter \\nenumerated, namely:— \\n\\nFirst.—Robbery; \\n\\nSecondly.—House-breaking by night; \\n\\nThirdly.—Mischief by fire committed on any building, tent or vessel, which building, tent or vessel is \\n\\nused as a human dwelling, or as a place for the custody of property; \\n\\nFourthly.—Theft,  mischief,  or  house-trespass,  under  such  circumstances  as  may  reasonably  cause \\napprehension that death or grievous hurt will be the consequence, if such right of private defence is not \\nexercised. \\n\\nSTATE AMENDMENTS \\n\\nKarnataka \\n\\n(1) In section 103, in clause Thirdly, — \\n\\n(i) after the words “mischief by fire”, the words “or any explosive substance” Shall be inserted; \\n\\n(ii) after the words “as a human dwelling, or”the words “as a place of worship, or” shall be inserted. \\n\\n(2) After clause Fourthly, the following clause shall be inserted namely:— \\n\\n“Fifthly.— Mischief by fire or any explosive substance committed on any property used or intended to \\nbe  used  for  the  purpose  of  Government  or  any  local  authority,  statutory  body  or  company  owned  or \\ncontrolled by Government or railway or any vehicle used or adapted to be used for the carriage of passengers \\nfor hire or reward”. \\n\\n[Vide Karnataka Act 8 of 1972, sec. 2]. \\n\\n104.  When  such  right  extends  to  causing  any  harm  other  than  death.—If  the  offence,  the \\ncommitting  of  which,  or  the  attempting  to  commit  which  occasions  the  exercise  of  the  right  of  private \\ndefence,  be  theft,  mischief,  or  criminal  trespass,  not  of  any  of  the  descriptions  enumerated  in  the  last \\npreceding section, that right does not extend to the voluntary causing of death, but does extend, subject to \\nthe restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the wrong-doer of any harm other than \\ndeath. \\n\\n105. Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of property.—The right of \\nprivate  defence  of  property  commences  when  a  reasonable  apprehension  of  danger  to  the  property \\ncommences. \\n\\nThe right of private defence of property against theft continues till the offender has effected his retreat \\nwith  the  property  or  either  the  assistance  of the public  authorities is  obtained,  or  the property  has  been \\nrecovered. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Ins. by Act 13 of 2013, s. 2 (w.e.f. 3-2-2013). \\n\\n29 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0cThe right of private defence of property against robbery continues as long as the offender causes or \\nattempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or as long as the fear of instant death or \\nof instant hurt or of instant personal restraint continues. \\n\\nThe right of private defence of property against criminal trespass or mischief continues as long as the \\n\\noffender continues in the commission of criminal trespass or mischief. \\n\\nThe right of private defence of property against house-breaking by night continues as long as the house-\\n\\ntrespass which has been begun by such house-breaking continues. \\n\\n106.  Right  of  private  defence  against  deadly  assault  when  there  is  risk  of  harm  to  innocent \\nperson.—If in the exercise of the right of private defence against an assault which reasonably causes the \\napprehension of death, the defender be so situated that he cannot effectually exercise that right without risk \\nof harm to an innocent person, his right of private defence extends to the running of that risk. \\n\\nA is attacked by a mob who attempt to murder him. He cannot effectually exercise his right of private defence without firing \\non the mob, and he cannot fire without risk of harming young children who are mingled with the mob. A commits no offence if by \\nso firing he harms any of the children. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nCHAPTER V \\n\\nOF ABETMENT \\n\\n107. Abetment of a thing.—A person abets the doing of a thing, who— \\n\\nFirst.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or \\n\\nSecondly.—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that \\nthing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of \\nthat thing; or \\n\\nThirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material \\nfact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing \\nto be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, a public officer, is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z, B, knowing that fact and also that C is \\nnot Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the \\napprehension of C. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in \\norder to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid \\nthe doing of that act. \\n\\n108.  Abettor.—A  person  abets  an  offence,  who  abets  either  the  commission  of  an  offence,  or  the \\ncommission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing \\nan offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence although the \\n\\nabettor may not himself be bound to do that act. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should be \\n\\ncommitted, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of instigating \\n\\nB to commit murder. \\n\\nExplanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an \\noffence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty \\nintention or knowledge. \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n30 \\n\\n\\x0cIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person \\ncapable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is \\nguilty of abetting an offence. \\n\\n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z\\'s death. \\nB, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z\\'s death. Here, though B was not capable \\nby law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an \\noffence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death. \\n\\n(c)  A  instigates  B  to  set  fire  to  a  dwelling-house.  B,  in  consequence  of  the  unsoundness  of  his  mind,  being  incapable  of \\nknowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A\\'s \\ninstigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to \\nthe punishment provided for that offence. \\n\\n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property belonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession. A induces \\nB to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z\\'s possession, in good faith, believing it to be A\\'s property. \\nB, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, \\nand is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft. \\n\\nExplanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also \\n\\nan offence. \\n\\nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence \\nof B\\'s instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the \\noffence, A is also liable to the same punishment. \\n\\nExplanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that \\nthe abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the \\nconspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed. \\n\\nA  concerts  with  B  a  plan  for  poisoning  Z.  It  is  agreed  that  A  shall  administer  the  poison.  B  then  explains  the  plan  to  C \\nmentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A\\'s name. C agrees to procure the poison, and \\nprocures  and  delivers  it  to  B  for  the  purpose  of  its  being  used  in  the  manner  explained.  A  administers  the  poison;  Z  dies  in \\nconsequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which \\nZ has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder. \\n\\n108A. Abetment in India of offences outside India.—A person abets an offence within the meaning \\nof this Code who, in India, abets the commission of any act without and beyond  India which would \\nconstitute an offence if committed in India. \\n\\nA, in India, instigates B, a foreigner in Goa, to commit a murder in Goa, A is guilty of abetting murder.] \\n\\n109. Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express \\nprovision is made for its punishment.—Whoever abets any offence shall, if the act abetted is committed \\nin consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is made by this Code for the punishment of such \\nabetment, be punished with the punishment provided for the offence. \\n\\nExplanation.—An  act  or  offence  is  said  to  be  committed  in  consequence  of  abetment,  when  it  is \\ncommitted  in  consequence  of  the  instigation,  or  in  pursuance  of  the  conspiracy,  or  with  the  aid  which \\nconstitutes the abetment. \\n\\n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing A some favour in the exercise of B\\'s official functions. B \\n\\naccepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined in section 161. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. Added by Act 4 of 1898, s. 3. \\n2. The words “British India” have successively been subs. by the A.O. 1948, the A.O. 1950 and Act 3 of 1951, s. 3 and the Sch., to \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n31 \\n\\nread as above. \\n\\n \\n\\n\\x0c(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting \\n\\nthat offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B. \\n\\n(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he \\nmay administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A’s absence and thereby causes Z’s death. \\nHere B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder. \\n\\n110.  Punishment  of  abetment  if  person  abetted  does  act  with  different  intention  from  that  of \\nabettor.—Whoever  abets the  commission of  an  offence  shall,  if the  person  abetted  does  the  act  with  a \\ndifferent intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for the \\noffence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge of the \\nabettor and with no other. \\n\\n111. Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done.—When an Act is abetted and \\na different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent as if \\nhe had directly abetted it: \\n\\nProvided  the  act  done  was  a  probable  consequence  of  the  abetment,  and  was  committed  under  the \\ninfluence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the abetment. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. The \\nchild, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y, which is by the side \\nof that of Z. Here, if the child was acting under the influence of A\\'s instigation, and the act done was under \\nthe circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable in the same manner and to the same \\nextent as if he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to burn Z’s house B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of \\nproperty there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for \\nthe theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning. \\n\\n(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and \\nprovides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the \\ninmates, murder Z. Here, if that murder was the probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable to the \\npunishment provided for murder. \\n\\n112. Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done.—If the act \\nfor which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committed in addition to the act abetted, \\nand constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences. \\n\\nA instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence, resists that distress. In offering the \\nresistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the distress. As B has committed both the offence of resisting \\nthe distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and, if A knew \\nthat B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each of the \\noffences. \\n\\n113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different from that intended by \\nthe abettor.—When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular \\neffect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a different effect \\nfrom that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in the same manner and to the \\nsame extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the \\nact abetted was likely to cause that effect. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA  instigates  B  to  cause  grievous  hurt  to  Z.  B,  in  consequence  of  the  instigation,  causes  grievous  hurt  to  Z.  Z  dies  in \\nconsequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the punishment \\nprovided for murder. \\n\\n114. Abettor present when offence is committed.—Whenever any person, who is absent would be \\nliable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in \\nconsequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence. \\n\\n \\n\\n32 \\n\\n\\x0c115.  Abetment  of  offence  punishable  with  death  or  imprisonment  for  life.—if  offence  not \\ncommitted.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for \\nlife, shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is \\nmade  by  this  Code  for  the  punishment  of  such  abetment,  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either \\ndescription for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine; \\n\\nif  act  causing  harm  be  done  in  consequence.—and  if  any  act  for  which  the  abettor  is  liable  in \\nconsequence of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable to \\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be liable \\nto fine. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA instigates B to murder Z. The offence is not committed. If B had murdered Z, he would have been subject to the punishment \\nof death or imprisonment for life. Therefore A is liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and also to \\na fine; and if any hurt be done to Z in consequence of the abetment, he will be liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend \\nto fourteen years, and to fine. \\n\\n116. Abetment of offence punishable with imprisonment—if offence be not committed.—Whoever \\nabets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of \\nthe  abetment,  and  no  express  provision  is  made  by  this  Code  for  the  punishment  of  such  abetment,  be \\npunished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence for a term which may extend to \\none-fourth  part  of  the  longest  term  provided  for  that  offence;  or  with  such  fine  as  is  provided  for  that \\noffence, or with both; \\n\\nif abettor or person abetted be a public servant whose duty it is to prevent offence.—and if the \\nabettor or the person abetted is a public servant, whose duty it is to prevent the commission of such offence, \\nthe abettor shall be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence, for a term \\nwhich may extend to one-half of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such fine as is provided \\nfor the offence, or with both. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing. A somefavour in the exercise of B’s official functions. B \\n\\nrefuses to accept the bribe. A is punishable under this section. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. Here, if B does not give false evidence, A has nevertheless committed the offence \\n\\ndefined in this section, and is punishable accordingly. \\n\\n(c) A, a police-officer, whose duty it is to prevent robbery, abets the commission of robbery. Here, though the robbery be not \\n\\ncommitted, A is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for that offence, and also to fine. \\n\\n(d) B abets the commission of a robbery by A, a police-officer, whose duty it is to prevent that offence. Here, though the \\nrobbery be not committed, B is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for the offence of robbery, and also \\nto fine. \\n\\n117. Abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than ten persons.—Whoever abets \\nthe commission of an offence by the public generally or by any number or class of persons exceeding ten, \\nshall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or \\nwith fine, or with both. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA affixes in a public place a placard instigating a sect consisting of more than ten members to meet at a certain time and place, \\nfor the purpose of attacking the members of an adverse sect, while engaged in a procession. A has committed the offence defined \\nin this section. \\n\\n118.  Concealing  design  to  commit  offence  punishable  with  death  or  imprisonment  for  life.—\\nWhoever intending to facilitate or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby facilitate the commission of \\nan offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life, \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n                                                           \\n1.

A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he \\nmay administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A’s absence and thereby causes Z’s death. \\nHere B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder. \\n\\n110.  Punishment  of  abetment  if  person  abetted  does  act  with  different  intention  from  that  of \\nabettor.—Whoever  abets the  commission of  an  offence  shall,  if the  person  abetted  does  the  act  with  a \\ndifferent intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, be punished with the punishment provided for the \\noffence which would have been committed if the act had been done with the intention or knowledge of the \\nabettor and with no other. \\n\\n111. Liability of abettor when one act abetted and different act done.—When an Act is abetted and \\na different act is done, the abettor is liable for the act done, in the same manner and to the same extent as if \\nhe had directly abetted it: \\n\\nProvided  the  act  done  was  a  probable  consequence  of  the  abetment,  and  was  committed  under  the \\ninfluence of the instigation, or with the aid or in pursuance of the conspiracy which constituted the abetment. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A instigates a child to put poison into the food of Z, and gives him poison for that purpose. The \\nchild, in consequence of the instigation, by mistake puts the poison into the food of Y, which is by the side \\nof that of Z. Here, if the child was acting under the influence of A\\'s instigation, and the act done was under \\nthe circumstances a probable consequence of the abetment, A is liable in the same manner and to the same \\nextent as if he had instigated the child to put the poison into the food of Y. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to burn Z’s house B sets fire to the house and at the same time commits theft of \\nproperty there. A, though guilty of abetting the burning of the house, is not guilty of abetting the theft; for \\nthe theft was a distinct act, and not a probable consequence of the burning. \\n\\n(c) A instigates B and C to break into an inhabited house at midnight for the purpose of robbery, and \\nprovides them with arms for that purpose. B and C break into the house, and being resisted by Z, one of the \\ninmates, murder Z.

Abettor when liable to cumulative punishment for act abetted and for act done.—If the act \\nfor which the abettor is liable under the last preceding section is committed in addition to the act abetted, \\nand constitute a distinct offence, the abettor is liable to punishment for each of the offences. \\n\\nA instigates B to resist by force a distress made by a public servant. B, in consequence, resists that distress. In offering the \\nresistance, B voluntarily causes grievous hurt to the officer executing the distress. As B has committed both the offence of resisting \\nthe distress, and the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, B is liable to punishment for both these offences; and, if A knew \\nthat B was likely voluntarily to cause grievous hurt in resisting the distress A will also be liable to punishment for each of the \\noffences. \\n\\n113. Liability of abettor for an effect caused by the act abetted different from that intended by \\nthe abettor.—When an act is abetted with the intention on the part of the abettor of causing a particular \\neffect, and an act for which the abettor is liable in consequence of the abetment, causes a different effect \\nfrom that intended by the abettor, the abettor is liable for the effect caused, in the same manner and to the \\nsame extent as if he had abetted the act with the intention of causing that effect, provided he knew that the \\nact abetted was likely to cause that effect. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA  instigates  B  to  cause  grievous  hurt  to  Z.  B,  in  consequence  of  the  instigation,  causes  grievous  hurt  to  Z.  Z  dies  in \\nconsequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the punishment \\nprovided for murder. \\n\\n114. Abettor present when offence is committed.—Whenever any person, who is absent would be \\nliable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in \\nconsequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence. \\n\\n \\n\\n32 \\n\\n\\x0c115.  Abetment  of  offence  punishable  with  death  or  imprisonment  for  life.—if  offence  not \\ncommitted.—Whoever abets the commission of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for \\nlife, shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of the abetment, and no express provision is \\nmade  by  this  Code  for  the  punishment  of  such  abetment,  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either \\ndescription for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine; \\n\\nif  act  causing  harm  be  done  in  consequence.—and  if  any  act  for  which  the  abettor  is  liable  in \\nconsequence of the abetment, and which causes hurt to any person, is done, the abettor shall be liable to \\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to fourteen years, and shall also be liable \\nto fine. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA instigates B to murder Z. The offence is not committed. If B had murdered Z, he would have been subject to the punishment \\nof death or imprisonment for life. Therefore A is liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and also to \\na fine; and if any hurt be done to Z in consequence of the abetment, he will be liable to imprisonment for a term which may extend \\nto fourteen years, and to fine. \\n\\n116. Abetment of offence punishable with imprisonment—if offence be not committed.—Whoever \\nabets an offence punishable with imprisonment shall, if that offence be not committed in consequence of \\nthe  abetment,  and  no  express  provision  is  made  by  this  Code  for  the  punishment  of  such  abetment,  be \\npunished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence for a term which may extend to \\none-fourth  part  of  the  longest  term  provided  for  that  offence;  or  with  such  fine  as  is  provided  for  that \\noffence, or with both; \\n\\nif abettor or person abetted be a public servant whose duty it is to prevent offence.—and if the \\nabettor or the person abetted is a public servant, whose duty it is to prevent the commission of such offence, \\nthe abettor shall be punished with imprisonment of any description provided for that offence, for a term \\nwhich may extend to one-half of the longest term provided for that offence, or with such fine as is provided \\nfor the offence, or with both. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A offers a bribe to B, a public servant, as a reward for showing. A somefavour in the exercise of B’s official functions. B \\n\\nrefuses to accept the bribe. A is punishable under this section. \\n\\n(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. Here, if B does not give false evidence, A has nevertheless committed the offence \\n\\ndefined in this section, and is punishable accordingly. \\n\\n(c) A, a police-officer, whose duty it is to prevent robbery, abets the commission of robbery. Here, though the robbery be not \\n\\ncommitted, A is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for that offence, and also to fine. \\n\\n(d) B abets the commission of a robbery by A, a police-officer, whose duty it is to prevent that offence. Here, though the \\nrobbery be not committed, B is liable to one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for the offence of robbery, and also \\nto fine. \\n\\n117. Abetting commission of offence by the public or by more than ten persons.—Whoever abets \\nthe commission of an offence by the public generally or by any number or class of persons exceeding ten, \\nshall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or \\nwith fine, or with both. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA affixes in a public place a placard instigating a sect consisting of more than ten members to meet at a certain time and place, \\nfor the purpose of attacking the members of an adverse sect, while engaged in a procession. A has committed the offence defined \\nin this section. \\n\\n118.

A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient \\nin the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring \\nunder any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here \\nA, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury \\nas in the ordinary course of nature would cause death. \\n\\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. \\n\\nZ dies in consequence. Here A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z\\'s death. \\n\\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although \\n\\nhe may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual. \\n\\nException  1.—When  culpable  homicide  is  not  murder.—Culpable  homicide  is  not  murder  if  the \\noffender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death \\nof the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. \\n\\nThe above exception is subject to the following provisos:— \\n\\nFirst.—That the  provocation  is  not  sought  or  voluntarily  provoked  by  the offender as an  excuse for \\n\\nkilling or doing harm to any person. \\n\\nSecondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public \\n\\nservant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant. \\n\\nThirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private \\n\\ndefence. \\n\\n \\n\\n73 \\n\\n\\x0cExplanation.—Whether  the  provocation  was  grave  and  sudden  enough  to  prevent  the  offence  from \\n\\namounting to murder is a question of fact. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z\\'s child. This is murder, \\ninasmuch as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in \\ndoing an act caused by the provocation. \\n\\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing \\nhimself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable \\nhomicide. \\n\\n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, \\n\\ninasmuch as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers. \\n\\n(d) A appears as a witness before Z, a Magistrate. Z says that he does not believe a word of A\\'s deposition, and that A has \\n\\nperjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder. \\n\\n(e)A attempts to pull Z\\'s nose. Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. \\nA is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, inasmuch as the provocation was giving by \\na thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence. \\n\\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B\\'s rage, and to \\ncause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B\\'s hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable \\nhomicide, but A is guilty of murder. \\n\\nException 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender in the exercise in good faith of the right \\nof private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of \\nthe person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any \\nintention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. \\nA  believing  in  good  faith  that  he  can  by  no  other  means  prevent  himself  from  being  horsewhipped,  shoots  Z  dead.  A  has  not \\ncommitted murder, but only culpable homicide. \\n\\nException 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public \\nservant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes \\ndeath by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of \\nhis duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused. \\n\\nException 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden \\nfight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender\\'s having taken undue advantage \\nor acted in a cruel or unusual manner. \\n\\nExplanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first \\n\\nassault. \\n\\nException 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above \\n\\nthe age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes Z, a person under eighteen years of age to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z\\'s youth, \\n\\nhe was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder. \\n\\n301.  Culpable  homicide  by  causing  death  of  person  other  than  person  whose  death  was \\nintended.—If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, commits \\nculpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither intends nor knows himself \\nto be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of which it \\nwould have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or knew himself to he \\nlikely to cause. \\n\\n \\n\\n74 \\n\\n\\x0c302.  Punishment  for  murder.—Whoever  commits  murder  shall  be  punished  with  death  or \\n\\nimprisonment for life,  and shall also be liable to fine. \\n\\n303. Punishment for murder by life-convict.—Whoever, being under sentence of imprisonment for \\n\\nlife, commits murder, shall be punished with death. \\n\\n304. Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.—Whoever commits culpable \\nhomicide not amounting to murder, shall be punished with  imprisonment for life, or imprisonment of \\neither description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by \\nwhich the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is \\nlikely to cause death; \\n\\nor with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or \\nwith both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to \\ncause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. \\n\\n304A. Causing death by negligence.—Whoever causes the death of any person by doing any rash \\nor  negligent  act  not  amounting  to  culpable  homicide,  shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of  either \\ndescription for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. \\n\\nHimachal Pradesh.— \\n\\nSTATE AMENDMENTS \\n\\nAfter Section 304 A of the Indian Penal Code, 1860,  in its application to the State of Himachal \\n\\nPradesh, the following section shall be added, namely: — \\n\\n“304-AA.

Force.—A  person  is  said  to  use  force  to  another  if  he  causes  motion,  change  of  motion,  or \\ncessation of motion to that other, or if he causes to any substance such motion, or change of motion, or \\ncessation of motion as brings that substance into contact with any part of that other\\'s body, or with anything \\nwhich that other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so situated that such contact affects that other\\'s \\nsense of feeling: Provided that the person causing the motion, or change of motion, or cessation of motion, \\ncauses that motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion in one of the three ways hereinafter described: \\n\\nFirst.—By his own bodily power. \\n\\nSecondly.—By disposing any substance in such a manner that the motion or change or cessation of \\n\\nmotion takes place without any further act on his part, or on the part of any other person. \\n\\nThirdly.—By inducing any animal to move, to change its motion, or to cease to move. \\n\\n350. Criminal force.—Whoever intentionally uses force to any person, without that person\\'s consent, \\nin order to the committing of any offence, or intending by the use of such force to cause, or knowing it to \\nbe likely that by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person to whom the \\nforce is used, is said to use criminal force to that other. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) Z is sitting in a moored boat on a river. A unfastens the moorings, and thus intentionally causes the boat to drift down the \\nstream. Here A intentionally causes motion to Z, and he does this by disposing substances in such a manner that the motion is \\nproduced without any other action on any person\\'s part. A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without \\nZ\\'s consent, in order to the committing of any offence, or intending or knowing it to be likely that this use of force will cause injury, \\nfear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(b) Z is riding in a chariot. A lashes Z\\'s horses, and thereby causes them to quicken their pace. Here A has caused change of \\nmotion to Z by inducing the animals to change their motion. A has therefore used force to Z; and if A has done this without Z\\'s \\nconsent, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, A has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(c) Z is riding in a palanquin. A, intending to rob Z, seizes the pole and stops the palanquin. Here A has caused cessation of \\nmotion to Z, and he has done this by his own bodily power. A has therefore used force to Z; and as A has acted thus intentionally, \\nwithout Z\\'s consent, in order to the commission of an offence. A has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(d) A intentionally pushes against Z in the street. Here A has by his own bodily power moved his own person so as to bring it \\ninto contact with Z. He has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done so without Z\\'s consent, intending or knowing \\nit to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force to Z. \\n\\n(e) A throws a stone, intending or knowing it to be likely that the stone will be thus brought into contact with Z, or with Z\\'s \\nclothes, or with something carried by Z, or that it will strike water and dash up the water against Z\\'s clothes or something carried \\nby Z. Here, if the throwing of the stone produce the effect of causing any substance to come into contact with Z, or Z\\'s clothes, A \\nhas used force to Z, and if he did so without Z\\'s consent, intending thereby to injure, frighten or annoy Z, he has used criminal force \\nto Z. \\n\\n(f) A intentionally pulls up a Woman\\'s veil. Here  A intentionally uses force to her, and if he does so without her consent \\n\\nintending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby injure, frighten or annoy her, he has used criminal force to her. \\n\\n(g) Z is bathing. A pours into the bath water which he knows to be boiling. Here A intentionally by his own bodily power \\ncauses such motion in the boiling water as brings that water into contact with Z, or with other water so situated that such contact \\nmust affect Z\\'s sense of feeling; A has therefore intentionally used force to Z; and if he has done this without Z\\'s consent intending \\nor knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, A has used criminal force. \\n\\n(h) A incites a dog to spring upon Z, without Z\\'s consent. Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses \\n\\ncriminal force to Z. \\n\\n \\n\\n82 \\n\\n\\x0c351. Assault.—Whoever makes any gesture, or any preparation intending or knowing it to be likely \\nthat such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend that he who makes that gesture \\nor preparation is about to use criminal force to that person, is said to commit an assault. \\n\\nExplanation.—Mere words do not amount to an assault. But the words which a person uses may give \\nto his gestures or preparation such a meaning as may make those gestures or preparations amount to an \\nassault. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A shakes his fist at Z, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to believe that A is about to strike \\n\\nZ. A has committed an assault. \\n\\n(b) A begins to unloose the muzzle of a ferocious dog, intending or knowing it to be likely that he may thereby cause Z to \\n\\nbelieve that he is about to cause the dog to attack Z. A has committed an assault upon Z. \\n\\n(c) A takes up a stick, saying to Z, “I will give you a beating”. Here, though the words used by A could in no case amount to \\nan assault, and though the mere gesture, unaccompanied by any other circumstances, might not amount to an assault,the gesture \\nexplained by the words may amount to an assault. \\n\\n352. Punishment for assault or criminal force otherwise than on grave provocation.—Whoever \\nassaults or uses criminal force to any person otherwise than on grave and sudden provocation given by that \\nperson, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three \\nmonths, or with fine which may extend to five hundred rupees, or with both. \\n\\nExplanation.—Grave and sudden provocation will not mitigate the punishment for an offence under \\nthis  section,  if  the  provocation  is  sought  or  voluntarily  provoked  by  the  offender  as  an  excuse  for  the \\noffence, or \\n\\nif the provocation is given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant, in the \\n\\nlawful exercise of the powers of such public servant, or \\n\\nif the provocation is given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence. \\n\\n Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to mitigate the offence, is a question of fact. \\n\\n353.  Assault  or  criminal  force  to  deter  public  servant  from  discharge  of  his  duty.—Whoever \\nassaults or uses criminal force to any person being a public servant in the execution of his duty as such \\npublic servant, or with intent to prevent or deter that person from discharging his duty as such public servant, \\nor in consequence of anything done or attempted to be done by such person to the lawful discharge of his \\nduty as such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which \\nmay extend to two years, or with fine, or with both. \\n\\nSTATE AMENDMENT \\n\\nAmendment of section 353 of 45 of 1860.—In section 353 of the said Code, for the words “two years” \\n\\nMaharashtra.— \\n\\nthe words “five years” shall be substituted. \\n\\n[Vide Maharashtra Act 40 of 2018, sec. 3] \\n\\n354.

Theft.—Whoever, intending to take dishonestly any movable property out of the possession of \\nany person without that person\\'s consent, moves that property in order to such taking, is said to commit \\ntheft. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A thing so long as it is attached to the earth, not being movable property, is not the \\nsubject of theft; but it becomes capable of being the subject of theft as soon as it is severed from the earth. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—A moving effected by the same act which effects the severance may be a theft. \\n\\nExplanation 3.—A person is said to cause a thing to move by removing an obstacle which prevented it \\n\\nfrom moving or by separating it from any other thing, as well as by actually moving it. \\n\\nExplanation 4.—A person, who by any means causes an animal to move, is said to move that animal, \\n\\nand to move everything which, in consequence of the motion so caused, is moved by that animal. \\n\\nExplanation 5.—The consent mentioned in the definition may be express or implied, and may be given \\neither by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or \\nimplied. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A cuts down a tree on Z\\'s ground, with the intention of dishonestly taking the tree out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent. \\n\\nHere, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft. \\n\\n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z\\'s dog to follow it. Here, if A\\'s intention be dishonestly to take the \\n\\ndog out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent, A has committed theft as soon as Z\\'s dog has begun to follow A. \\n\\n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly \\n\\ntake the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure. \\n\\n(d) A being Z\\'s servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z\\'s plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z\\'s consent. \\n\\nA has committed theft. \\n\\n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of a warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith \\nand sells it. Here the plate was not in Z\\'s possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z\\'s possession, and A has not committed \\ntheft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust. \\n\\n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z\\'s possession, and if A dishonestly \\n\\nremoves it, A commits theft. \\n\\ncommit criminal misappropriation of property. \\n\\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A, by taking it, commits no theft, though he may \\n\\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z\\'s house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear \\nof search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention \\nof taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first  moving the ring, \\ncommits theft. \\n\\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for \\nwhich the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z\\'s hand, \\nand carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as \\nwhat he did was not done dishonestly.  \\n\\n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the \\nwatch out of Z\\'s possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch \\nas he takes it dishonestly. \\n\\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent, not having paid what he \\n\\nborrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly. \\n\\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession without Z\\'s consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains \\n\\nmoney from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefor committed theft. \\n\\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z\\'s library in Z\\'s absence, and takes away a book without Z\\'s express consent \\nfor the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he \\nhad Z\\'s implied consent to use Z\\'s book. If this was A\\'s impression, A has not committed theft. \\n\\n(n) A asks charity from Z\\'s wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is \\nprobable that A may conceive that Z\\'s wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A\\'s impression, A has not committed theft. \\n\\n(o) A is the paramour of Z\\'s wife. She gives a valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such \\n\\nproperty as she has not authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft. \\n\\n \\n\\n95 \\n\\n\\x0c(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A\\'s own property, takes that property out of B\\'s possession. Here, \\n\\nas A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft. \\n\\n379.

A has committed the offence defined in this section. \\n\\n(b)  A  picks  Z\\'s  pocket,  having posted  several  of  his  companions near  him,  in order that they  may  restrain  Z,  if  Z  should \\nperceive what is passing and should resist, or should attempt to apprehend A.

Subs. by Act 26 of 1955, s. 117 and the Sch., for “transportation for life” (w.e.f. 1-1-1956). \\n\\n \\n\\n99 \\n\\n\\x0cIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A takes property belonging to Z out of Z\\'s possession, in good faith believing at the time when he takes it, that the property \\nbelongs to himself. A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own \\nuse, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\n(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z\\'s library in Z\\'s absence, and takes away a book without Z\\'s express consent. \\nHere, if  A  was under the impression that he had Z\\'s implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has not \\ncommitted theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section. \\n\\n(c) A and B, being, joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B\\'s possession, intending to use it. Here, as A has a right \\nto use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it.

A, in order to defraud B, adds cipher to the 10,000, and makes the sum \\n\\n1,00,000 intending that it may be believed by B that Z so wrote the letter. A has committed forgery.  \\n\\n(b) A, without Z\\'s authority, affixes Z\\'s seal to a document purporting to be a conveyance of an estate from Z to A, with the intention of selling \\n\\nthe estate to B and thereby of obtaining from B the purchase-money. A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(c) A picks up a cheque on a banker signed by B, payable to bearer, but without any sum having been inserted in the cheque. A fraudulently \\n\\nfills up the cheque by inserting the sum of ten thousand rupees. A commits forgery. \\n\\n(d) A leaves with B, his agent, a cheque on a banker, signed by A, without inserting the sum payable and authorizes B to fill up the cheque \\nby inserting a sum not exceeding ten thousand rupees for the purpose of making certain payments. B fraudulently fills up the cheque by inserting \\nthe sum of twenty thousand rupees. B commits forgery. \\n\\n(e) A draws a bill of exchange on himself in the name of B without B\\'s authority, intending to discount it as a genuine bill with a banker and \\nintending to take up the bill on its maturity. Here, as A draws the bill with intent to deceive the banker by leading him to suppose that he had the \\nsecurity of B, and thereby to discount the bill, A is guilty of forgery. \\n\\n(f) Z\\'s will contains these words—“I direct that all my remaining property be equally divided between A, B and C.” A dishonestly scratches \\n\\nout B\\'s name, intending that it may be believed that the whole was left to himself and C. A has committed forgery. \\n\\n                                                           \\n1. The words “TRADE OR” omitted by Act 43 of 1958, s. 135 and Sch. (w.e.f. 25-11-1959). \\n2.

Subs. by Act 10 of 2009, s. 51, for “digital signature” (w.e.f. 27-10-2009). \\n\\n \\n\\n109 \\n\\n\\x0c(g) A endorses a Government promissory note and makes it payable to Z or his order by writing on the bill the words “Pay to Z or his order” \\nand signing the endorsement. B dishonestly erases the words “Pay to Z or his order”, and thereby converts the special endorsement into a blank \\nendorsement. B commits forgery. \\n\\n(h) A sells and conveys an estate to Z. A afterwards, in order to defraud Z of his estate, executes a conveyance of the same estate to B, dated \\nsix months earlier than the date of the conveyance to Z, intending it to be believed that he had conveyed the estate to B before he conveyed it to Z. \\nA has committed forgery. \\n\\n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will \\n\\naccording to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B\\'s name without B\\'s authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances \\nfrom unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order \\nto induce Z to part with property, A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(k) A without B\\'s authority writes a letter and signs it in B\\'s name certifying to A\\'s character, intending thereby to obtain employment under \\nZ. A has committed forgery inasmuch as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or \\nimplied contract for service. \\n\\nExplanation 1.—A man’s signature of his own name may amount to forgery. \\n\\nIllustrations \\n\\n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. \\n\\nA has committed forgery. \\n\\n(b) A writes the word “accepted” on a piece of paper and signs it with Z\\'s name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of \\nexchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws \\nthe bill upon the paper pursuant to A\\'s intention, B is also guilty of forgery. \\n\\n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending \\n\\nto cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person to whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery. \\n\\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of \\nthe estate, to Z at a nominal rent and for a long period and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it \\nto be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it. \\n\\n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A\\'s benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to give \\na colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it \\nmay be believed to have been made before A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition. \\n\\nExplanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictious person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by \\na real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount \\nto forgery. \\n\\nIllustration \\n\\nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it. \\nA commits forgery. \\n\\nExplanation 3.—For the purposes of this section, the expression “affixing electronic signature” shall have the \\nmeaning assigned to it in clause (d) of sub-section (1) of section 2 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (21 of \\n2000).] \\n\\n465.
