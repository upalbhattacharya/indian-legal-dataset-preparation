      "interest of justice to inquire into the offence which appears to have been\n",
      "committed. To quote:\n",
      "\n",
      "“9. Reading of the sub-section makes it clear that the hub of this provision\n",
      "is formation of an opinion by the court (before which proceedings were to be\n",
      "held) that it is expedient in the interest of justice that an inquiry should\n",
      "be made into an offence which appears to have been committed. In order to form\n",
      "such opinion the court is empowered to hold a preliminary inquiry. It is not\n",
      "peremptory that such preliminary inquiry should be held. Even without such\n",
      "preliminary inquiry the court can form such an opinion when it appears to the\n",
      "court that an offence has been committed in relation to a proceeding in that\n",
      "court. It is important to notice that even when the court forms such an\n",
      "opinion it is not mandatory that the court should make a complaint. This sub-\n",
      "section has conferred a power on the court to do so. It does not mean that the\n",
      "court should, as a matter of course, make a complaint. But once the court\n",
      "decides to do so, then the court should make a finding to the effect that on\n",
      "the fact situation it is expedient in the interest of justice that the offence\n",
      "should further be probed into. If the court finds it necessary to conduct a\n",
      "preliminary inquiry to reach such a finding it is always open to the court to\n",
      "do so, though absence of any such preliminary inquiry would not vitiate a\n",
      "finding reached by the court regarding its opinion. It should again be\n",
      "remembered that the preliminary inquiry contemplated in the sub-section is not\n",
      "for finding whether any particular person is guilty or not. Far from that, the\n",
      "purpose of preliminary inquiry, even if the court opts to conduct it, is only\n",
      "to decide whether it is expedient in the interest of justice to inquire into\n",
      "the offence which appears to have been committed.” In the impugned order, the\n",
      "High Court did form an opinion after the inquiry. To quote:\n",
      "\n",
      "“90. It was argued on behalf of the state by the learned standing counsel that\n",
      "the ballistic expert’s deposition, Ex. PW-95 was calculated to let the accused\n",
      "Manu Sharma off the hooks. It was submitted that the witness had stated that\n",
      "no definite opinion could be given whether the two empty cartridges were fired\n",
      "from the same weapon. However, on the basis of the same material, he took a\n",
      "somersault and gave a completely contrary opinion in the Court saying that\n",
      "they appear to have been fired from different weapons. It was submitted that\n",
      "by the time this witness stepped on to the box, the defence had formed its\n",
      "definite plan about a “two weapon theory”.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deposition of this witness was sought to support the “two weapon theory”.\n",
      "That this court and Supreme Court rejected the theory did not in any way\n",
      "undermine the fact that PW-95 gave false evidence.” Therefore, what is to be\n",
      "seen is whether the High Court is justified in forming the opinion on\n",
      "commission of the offence under Section 193 of IPC.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stand of the appellant in his report (Ex PW-95/2) dated 04.02.2000, and\n",
      "while deposing before the court at the trial, it is to be noted, was\n",
      "consistent. Query No.3 was whether both the empty cartridges were fired from\n",
      "the same firearm or otherwise. Since there was no recovery of the firearm, the\n",
      "same was not sent along with the cartridges for the examination by the expert.\n",
      "Therefore, the opinion tendered was that he was unable to give any definite\n",
      "opinion in answer to Query No.3, “unless the suspected firearm is available\n",
      "for examination.” It was at that juncture, there was a court question.\n",
      "According to the court, “for reply to query no.\n",
      "\n",
      "3, the presence of the firearm was not necessary. The question was whether the\n",
      "two empty cartridges have been fired from one instrument or from different\n",
      "instruments”. To that question, the appellant responded that “after\n",
      "comparison, I am of the opinion that these two cartridge cases C/1 and C/2\n",
      "appeared to have been fired from two different firearms”. It is not a clear,\n",
      "conclusive, specific and definite opinion. In further examination, the\n",
      "appellant has clearly stated that “I have already stated these two cartridge\n",
      "cases appear to have been fired from two different fire arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Definite opinion would have been given once the weapon is given to me for\n",
      "examination”.\n",
      "\n",
      "We fail to understand how the stand taken by the appellant, as above, attracts\n",
      "the offence of perjury. As we have already observed above, the appellant has\n",
      "all through been consistent that as an expert, a definite opinion in the case\n",
      "could be given only if the suspected firearm is available for examination. It\n",
      "is nobody’s case that scientifically an expert can give a definite opinion by\n",
      "only examining the cartridges as to whether they have been fired from the same\n",
      "firearm. It was the trial court which insisted for an opinion without the\n",
      "presence of the firearm, and in that context only, the appellant gave the non-\n",
      "specific and indefinite opinion. An expert, in such a situation, could not\n",
      "probably have given a different opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, this Court, in the decision rendered on the appeal filed by the\n",
      "accused and reported in Sidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma v. State (NCT of\n",
      "Delhi)[3], has specifically dealt with the issue explaining, and in a way,\n",
      "justifying the stand of the appellant. To quote:\n",
      "\n",
      "“180. Similar is the case with the expert opinion of PW 95 which is again\n",
      "inconclusive. There is no evidence on record to suggest that PW 95 gave an\n",
      "opinion to oblige the prosecution. On the contrary, his response to the court\n",
      "question reveals that he was extremely confused as to the issue which had to\n",
      "be addressed by him in the capacity of an expert. In the concluding part of\n",
      "his testimony he reaffirms the opinion given by him which is that without test\n",
      "firing the empties from the weapon of offence no conclusive opinion can be\n",
      "given.” (Emphasis supplied) This Court in State (Delhi) v. Pali Ram[4] held\n",
      "that:\n",
      "\n",
      "“51. ….the real function of the expert is to put before the court all the\n",
      "materials, together with reasons which induce him to come to the conclusion,\n",
      "so that the court, although not an expert, may form its own judgment by its\n",
      "own observation of those materials. Ordinarily, it is not proper for the court\n",
      "to ask the expert to give his finding upon any of the issues, whether of law\n",
      "or fact, because, strictly speaking, such issues are for the court or jury to\n",
      "determine”.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Ramesh Chandra Aggrawala v. Regency Hospitals[5], this Court has dealt with\n",
      "the difference between an ‘expert’ and ‘a witness of fact’.\n",
      "\n",
      "“20. An expert is not a witness of fact and his evidence is really of an\n",
      "advisory character. The duty of an expert witness is to furnish the Judge with\n",
      "the necessary scientific criteria for testing the accuracy of the conclusions\n",
      "so as to enable the Judge to form his independent judgment by the application\n",
      "of these criteria to the facts proved by the evidence of the case. The\n",
      "scientific opinion evidence, if intelligible, convincing and tested becomes a\n",
      "factor and often an important factor for consideration along with other\n",
      "evidence of the case. The credibility of such a witness depends on the reasons\n",

      "Handwriting Experts. An expert witness, however, impartial he may wish to be,\n",
      "is likely to be unconsciously prejudiced in favour of the side which calls\n",

      "especially when the expert himself has lodged a caveat regarding his inability\n",

      "approached this Court by way of these appeals.\n",
      "\n",
      "2\\. The facts giving rise to the present appeals, in a nut-shell, are as\n",
      "under:\n",
      "\n",
      "The appellants are businessmen having their manufacturing units in the State\n",
      "of Kerala and they are manufacturing different articles with the help of\n",
      "electricity, which is generated/supplied by the Kerala State Electricity Board\n",
      "(hereinafter referred to as ‘the Board’). The respondent-Government was\n",
      "desirous of having industrial development in the State of Kerala and\n",
      "therefore, it had framed certain policies so as to encourage and invite\n",
      "businessmen for setting up their manufacturing units in the State of Kerala.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to shortage of electricity supply in the State of Kerala, interested\n",
      "entrepreneurs were not inclined to set up their units in the State of Kerala.\n",
      "In view of the aforestated circumstances, the State Government had laid down a\n",
      "policy whereby it declared to give continuous electricity supply at a\n",
      "particular rate to certain new manufacturing units.\n",
      "\n",
      "3\\. So as to put the aforestated policy in practice, the respondent-State had\n",
      "issued a Government Order dated 21st May, 1990 which read as under:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Government have been considering the question of giving some incentives to\n",
      "new industries in the matter of power connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking into consideration the announcements made by the Minister (Finance) in\n",
      "the current year’s budget speech and after discussions with all concerned,\n",
      "Government are now pleased to issue the following orders in this context which\n",
      "will have effect from 1-4-1990.\n",
      "\n",
      "1\\. Power connection will be given on completion of any project irrespective\n",
      "of whether a general power cut is in force or not.\n",
      "\n",
      "2\\. New units commencing industrial production will be exempted from power cut\n",
      "for a period of 5 years from the date of commercial production.\n",
      "\n",
      "3\\. Exemption from payment of electricity duty for a period of 5 years from\n",
      "the date of commencement of commercial production will be given to the new\n",
      "units.\n",
      "\n",
      "4\\. In future the electricity duty will not be collected from the industries\n",
      "if they are eligible for exemption.\n",
      "\n",
      "5\\. Service connection charges will not be levied if no extension is required\n",
      "or if the additional line to be provided is less than 500 meters in length.”\n",
      "The aforestated State Government Order had been adopted by the Board by its\n",
      "Order dated 19th June, 1990.\n",
      "\n",
      "4\\. By virtue of the aforestated policy declared under the order dated 21st\n",
      "May, 1990, the respondent-State had assured the manufacturing units to be set\n",
      "up in the State of Kerala that electricity connection would be given to the\n",
      "projects which might be set up and they would be exempted from power cut for a\n",
      "period of 5 years from the date of commencement of commercial production. Such\n",
      "new units were also given certain exemption in relation to payment of\n",
      "electricity duty for a period of five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "5\\. It is not in dispute that in pursuance of the aforestated policy the\n",
      "appellants had established their manufacturing units (hereinafter referred to\n",
      "as ‘the new units’) in the respondent-State. It is also not in dispute that\n",
      "the requisite conditions, which had been imposed upon such new units, had been\n",
      "fully complied with by the appellants and therefore, the appellants were\n",
      "entitled to an uninterrupted electricity supply for a period of 5 years from\n",
      "the date on which they had commenced their commercial production.\n",
      "\n",
      "6\\. The respondent-State had thereafter passed a further order on 6th\n",
      "February, 1992, whereby the new units were exempted for 5 years from the\n",
      "payment of enhanced power tariff on certain conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the appellants, they were also entitled to benefit under the\n",
      "aforestated G.O. dated 6th February, 1992\\.\n",
      "\n",
      "7\\. In spite of the assurance given by the respondent-State to the new units\n",
      "that they would not suffer any power cut, because of certain difficulties\n",
      "faced by the Board with regard to supply of electricity to new units, there\n",
      "used to be power cuts which adversely affected the new units. In view of the\n",
      "said fact, to alleviate the difficulties of the units set up under the\n",
      "aforestated policy, the respondent-State passed further order on 26th October,\n",
      "1999, whereby it granted extension of period of assured power supply to the\n",
      "new units, who were adversely affected because of the power cut in certain\n",
      "circumstances. Under the aforestated order, it was decided and declared to\n",
      "extend the benefit which had been given under G.O. dated 25th May, 1990 and\n",
      "6th February, 1992 to the new units by number of days during which supply of\n",
      "electricity to them had been cut to the extent of 50% or more. The respondent-\n",
      "State also decided to reimburse the Board with the amount of benefit which was\n",
      "given to the new units on account of power cut beyond 50%.\n",
      "\n",
      "8\\. In the aforestated admitted facts and circumstances, the respondent- State\n",
      "should have given the benefits which had been assured to the new units but for\n",
      "the reasons beyond control of the State as well as the Board, the benefits\n",
      "assured to the new units could not be given and therefore, along with other\n",
      "industrial units, the present appellants had filed writ petitions before the\n",
      "High Court of Kerala praying that the benefits which had been assured to them\n",
      "should be given and they should not be constrained to pay tariff at the\n",
      "enhanced rate.\n",
      "\n",
      "9\\. Thus, according to the appellants, in fact, they did not get real benefit\n",
      "of the policy because their production was adversely affected whenever there\n",
      "was power cut and the five years’ period of exemption from power cut was not\n",
      "extended by the Government which was in violation of the promise given to the\n",
      "appellants and other similarly situated new units.\n",
      "\n",
      "10\\. All these grievances were ventilated before the High Court by filing\n",
      "different petitions which were ultimately rejected by the High Court by virtue\n",
      "of the impugned order.\n",
      "\n",
      "11\\. The learned counsel appearing for the appellants had vehemently submitted\n",
      "that it was unfair on the part of the respondent -State not to adhere to the\n",
      "promise given to the appellants with regard to uninterrupted 100% electricity\n",
      "supply. The appellants had set up their industries in the State of Kerala\n",
      "because of the promise given by the respondent-State that at least for a\n",
      "period of first 5 years from the date of commencement of the commercial\n",
      "production, there would be uninterrupted power supply and there would not be\n",
      "any increase in the tariff and therefore, the respondent-State was bound by\n",
      "the said policy. The principle of promissory estoppel was also invoked by the\n",
      "appellants.\n",
      "\n",
      "12\\. The learned counsel had further submitted that if for some reason it was\n",
      "not possible for the respondent- State to give uninterrupted 100% electricity\n",
      "supply to the appellants on a particular day, the said period or the said day\n",
      "should have been added to the period of 5 years for which the respondent-State\n",
      "had promised uninterrupted 100% electricity supply to the new units.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the learned counsel, though, the period had been extended, but\n",
      "not in a fair and reasonable manner because the days during which there was\n",
      "cut of electricity supply to the extent of 50% or more, were added to the\n",
      "period of 5 years. According to the learned counsel, whenever there was any\n",
      "reduction in power supply, even if the reduction or cut was 50% or less, the\n",
      "said period should have been added to the period of 5 years, for the reason\n",
      "that in case of continuing process industries, for proper functioning of the\n",
      "manufacturing units, uninterrupted 100% supply of electricity is a sine qua\n",
      "non.\n",
      "\n",
      "13\\. The learned counsel had shown us some material whereby it was shown that\n",
      "out of first 5 years during which the appellants were to be given benefit,\n",
      "there was electricity cut for 921 days and out of those 921 days there were\n",
      "214 days when the cut in electricity supply was for more than 50%. It had been\n",
      "further submitted that the period during which even the electricity cut was\n",
      "less than 50%, the new units could not work at its optimum level, which had\n",
      "resulted into several problems for the appellants.\n",
      "\n",
      "14\\. He had further added that the respondent Board had accepted the policy of\n",
      "the State with regard to giving benefit to the new units for uninterrupted\n",
      "power supply on same tariff and therefore, the Board could not have asked for\n",
      "additional tariff during the period of 5 years, as extended by the period\n",
      "during which there was power cut.\n",
      "\n",
      "15\\. The learned counsel had also alleged that the respondent- State had given\n",
      "discriminatory treatment to the appellants by not giving uninterrupted 100%\n",
      "electricity supply because the State had given uninterrupted 100% electricity\n",
      "supply to certain other manufacturing units like Malabar Cement and the\n",
      "industries set up within the Export Processing Zone. It had been asserted that\n",
      "if the above stated manufacturing units could be given 100% uninterrupted\n",
      "electricity supply, there was no reason for denying the same benefit to the\n",
      "appellants.\n",
      "\n",
      "16\\. So as to substantiate the submission with regard to promissory estoppel,\n",
      "the learned counsel had relied upon certain judgments delivered by this Court.\n",
      "\n",
      "17\\. On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing for the respondent\n",
      "-State had submitted that the prayers made by the appellants before the High\n",
      "Court were unjust and therefore, their petitions and other petitions, praying\n",
      "for similar relief had rightly been rejected by the impugned order of the High\n",
      "Court.\n",
      "\n",
      "18\\. It had been also submitted that Section 22 B of the Indian Electricity\n",
      "Act, 1910 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Act’) enables the respondent-State\n",
      "to impose control on distribution and consumption of energy. Section 22 B of\n",
      "the Act reads as under:\n",
      "\n",
      "“Sector 22B. (1) Power to control the distribution and consumption of energy:-\n",
      "If the State Government is of opinion that it is necessary or expedient so to\n",
      "do, for maintaining the supply and securing the equitable distribution of\n",
      "energy, it may by order provide for regulating the supply, distribution,\n",
      "consumption or use thereof.”\n",
      "\n",
      "19\\. The aforestated provision, according to the learned counsel, enables the\n",
      "respondent-State to regulate the supply, distribution or consumption of\n",
      "electricity and as there was shortage of electricity supply, the respondent-\n",
      "State had to impose some electricity cut, so as to see that least problems\n",
      "were created to the residents and industrial units set up in the respondent-\n",
      "State.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Government authorities had to use their discretion in the matter of supply\n",
      "of electricity. The discretion which the respondent-State used was quite\n",
      "reasonable as it was not possible to give 100% electricity supply to all the\n",
      "consumers of electricity in the State. In the aforestated circumstances, the\n",
      "respondent- State had to regulate the supply by imposing some power cut, and\n",
      "unfortunately it resulted into some difficulties to the appellants.\n",
      "\n",
      "20\\. It had been further submitted by the learned counsel that, so as to\n",
      "reduce the difficulties of the appellants, the Government had issued an order\n",
      "whereby the days, during which electricity supply was cut beyond 50%, had been\n",
      "added to the period of 5 years during which the appellants were entitled to\n",
      "the concession declared by the State of Kerala. Thus, sufficient efforts were\n",
      "made to see that the benefits assured to the appellants were provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "21\\. It had been further submitted that the appellants cannot expect benefit\n",
      "of extension of period simply because there was negligible cut in the supply\n",
      "for very less period. Therefore, the respondent- State had decided that as and\n",
      "when the cut was 50% or more, the period for which such the cut had been\n",
      "effected would be added to the period of 5 years and the said decision was\n",
      "just and fair.\n",
      "\n",
      "22\\. The learned counsel had also submitted that all consumers of electricity,\n",
      "including the appellants were informed well in advance about the stoppage of\n",
      "electricity supply and thus, all possible efforts were made to see that the\n",
      "appellants and other similarly situated consumers were not put to much\n",
      "hardship.\n",
      "\n",
      "23\\. The learned counsel had further submitted that looking at the facts of\n",
      "the case, there would not be any promissory estoppel as submitted by the\n",
      "learned counsel appearing for the appellants. The learned counsel had relied\n",
      "upon the judgments delivered in the case of State of Haryana & Ors. v. Mahabir\n",
      "Vegetable Oils Pvt. Ltd., [[2011 (3) SCC 778]](/cgi-\n",
      "bin/LawCite?cit=2011%203%20SCC%20778) and State of Rajasthan & Anr. v. M/s\n",
      "Mahaveer Oil Industries & Ors., [1999(4) SCC 357] to substantiate their case\n",
      "to the effect that there could not be any promissory estoppel in such cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "24\\. We had heard the learned counsel at length and perused the impugned\n",
      "judgment and the judgments referred to in the course of hearing and the\n",
      "relevant material placed on record of this Court.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not in dispute that the appellants had set up their new units in the\n",
      "State of Kerala only upon knowing the policy with regard to uninterrupted\n",
      "power supply and that too at the same tariff for a period of 5 years from the\n",
      "date of commercial production.\n",
      "\n",
      "25\\. In the instant case, no case had been made out by the respondent- State\n",
      "that the appellants had committed any breach or were not entitled to any of\n",
      "the benefits or concessions which had been offered to them by the respondent-\n",
      "State. In the circumstances, the respondent-State was bound to give the\n",
      "benefits which had been assured to the appellants.\n",
      "\n",
      "26\\. Though the respondent-State was bound to supply uninterrupted 100%\n",
      "electricity required by the appellants, one cannot lose sight of the fact that\n",
      "at times there would be circumstances which would put the respondent-State and\n",
      "the Board into such a difficulty that they would not be in a position to\n",
      "fulfill the assurance given to the new units. It is not in dispute that the\n",
      "State of Kerala is not generating enough electricity to cater the needs of all\n",
      "its consumers in the State of Kerala. The respondent-State is not having a\n",
      "magic wand which would enable the State to generate more electricity. There\n",
      "might be several factors which might be adversely affecting the respondents\n",
      "and as a result thereof, the respondents might not be generating sufficient\n",
      "electricity so as to fulfill the needs of the appellants and other residents\n",
      "of the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "27\\. The question, thus, arises as to how the adversely affected persons who\n",
      "had been assured by a promise with regard to continuous supply of electricity\n",
      "for five years can be fairly compensated.\n",
      "\n",
      "28\\. It is true that the respondent-State came out with Government Order dated\n",
      "26th October, 1999, whereby it had decided that the period when there would be\n",
      "reduction or cut in supply of power to the extent of 50% or more, such period\n",
      "of power cut would be added to the period of 5 years, during which the\n",
      "appellants and other similarly situated persons were to be given continuous\n",
      "power supply.\n",
      "\n",
      "29\\. The learned counsel appearing for the respondents could not show us any\n",
      "justifiable reason for deciding as to why the respondent-State decided to give\n",
      "the benefit of extended period only when the power cut was 50% or more. It is\n",
      "pertinent to know that the cases where the consumer is having a continuous\n",
      "process industry, even power cut below 50% would adversely affect the\n",
      "manufacturing unit. It is a matter of common knowledge that in several\n",
      "industries, the manufacturing process can not be stopped abruptly. Many a\n",
      "times, restarting of the machines or boilers take lot of time and energy,\n",
      "which results into loss to the manufacturer. The said fact ought to have been\n",
      "considered by the State while taking the aforestated decision. The decision\n",
      "with regard to giving extension of time to such a limited extent is not\n",
      "reasonable and in our opinion, that would have surely affected the new units\n",
      "adversely.\n",
      "\n",
      "30\\. It is true that Section 22B of the Act enables the State Government to\n",
      "regulate the supply, distribution and consumption of electricity for the\n",
      "purpose of maintenance and supply of equitable distribution of energy but in\n",
      "our opinion, provisions of the said section are not much relevant for the\n",
      "reason that in the instant case, the respondent State had given an assurance\n",
      "with regard to uninterrupted supply of electricity and therefore, the\n",
      "respondents ought to have made provision for uninterrupted supply of\n",
      "electricity to the appellants and other similarly situated persons by\n",
      "regulating electricity supply in a proper manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "31\\. Framing such policies and doing the needful for its implementation are\n",
      "administrative functions of the respondent-State and therefore, normally this\n",
      "Court would not like to interfere with its policies but looking at the\n",
      "peculiar facts of the case, where an assurance had been given for\n",
      "uninterrupted supply of electricity, one would presume that the respondent-\n",
      "State must have made necessary arrangements to provide 100% uninterrupted\n",
      "supply of electricity for 5 years to the new units. If for any reason it was\n",
      "not possible to supply electricity as assured, the respondent-State ought to\n",
      "have extended the period of 5 years by the period during which assured\n",
      "electricity was not supplied. By doing so, the respondent-State could have\n",
      "made an effort to fulfill its promise and satisfied the persons who had acted\n",
      "on an assurance given by the State and set up their manufacturing units in the\n",
      "State of Kerala.\n",
      "\n",
      "32\\. Before laying down any policy which would give benefits to its subjects,\n",
      "the State must think about pros and cons of the policy and its capacity to\n",
      "give the benefits. Without proper appreciation of all the relevant factors,\n",
      "the State should not give any assurance, not only because that would be in\n",
      "violation of the principles of promissory estoppel but it would be unfair and\n",
      "immoral on the part of the State not to act as per its promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "33\\. In the instant case, the respondent-State was conscious about the fact\n",
      "that there was a problem with regard to supply of electricity in the State of\n",
      "Kerala and possibly for that reason industries which depended much upon\n",
      "electricity as a source of power were not inclined to establish new industries\n",
      "in the State of Kerala. Before setting up an industry, the entrepreneur or the\n",
      "industrialist considers several factors and thereupon takes several decisions\n",
      "like place of business, capacity at which production should be made, type of\n",
      "raw-material, etc. After considering all these factors, a final decision is\n",
      "taken with regard to setting up of an industry. For a new entrepreneur, such a\n",
      "decision is of vital importance because if he fails in his estimates or in\n",
      "consideration of all the relevant factors, there are all chances that he would\n",
      "fail not only in his business but he would completely ruin himself. Thus, one\n",
      "can very well appreciate that the appellants must have thought about all\n",
      "relevant factors, including the incentives offered by the respondent- State\n",
      "and might have decided to set up their industries in the respondent-State.\n",
      "While deciding this case, this Court would invariably keep in mind the\n",
      "circumstances in which the appellants had set up their industries in the State\n",
      "of Kerala.\n",
      "\n",
      "34\\. In view of the incentives and assurances given to the appellants along\n",
      "with others, who were desirous of setting up new industries, the appellants\n",
      "set up their new units which were much dependant upon continuous supply of\n",
      "electricity. One of the appellants is a Steel Re-rolling Mill. In Steel\n",
      "industry, when the industry is concerned with making of steel or re-rolling of\n",
      "steel, it requires lot of power and energy, and electricity being one of the\n",
      "important sources of power, the appellant was much dependent on continuous\n",
      "supply of electricity, which had been assured to it by the respondent-State.\n",
      "\n",
      "35\\. If an assurance was given to the appellants and similarly situated\n",
      "persons that they would be given 100% electricity supply for five years, the\n",
      "respondents can not riggle out of their liability by making a policy to the\n",
      "effect that the benefit by way of incentive would be extended only if the\n",
      "electricity supply was reduced to less than 50% on a particular day. A steel\n",
      "industry, for example, which cannot function without electricity or power in\n",
      "any other form, would be put to enormous inconvenience and loss if the power\n",
      "supply is not continuous. So as to reactivate or to restart the machines or to\n",
      "start the process afresh, the industry has to spend something more then what\n",
      "it would have spent if the supply or power namely, electricity was\n",
      "uninterrupted. Stoppage of manufacturing process would mean losses under\n",
      "several heads. The labour employed has to be paid even when the employer does\n",
      "not get work from the labour force. Very often, so as to bring a required\n",
      "temperature for the purpose of carrying on certain processes, more fuel is to\n",
      "be injected so as to attain the condition which was prevailing prior to\n",
      "electricity supply being disconnected. Moreover, there would be several\n",
      "overhead expenses which one has to incur even if there is no production or\n",
      "stoppage of manufacturing process.\n",
      "\n",
      "36\\. The judgments cited by the counsel appearing for the respondents would\n",
      "not help them for the reason that in the cases referred to, the Government had\n",
      "to change the policy in public interest. In the instant case, by compensating\n",
      "the aggrieved appellants, no harm would be caused to the State of Kerala\n",
      "except that it will have to compensate the appellants by supplying assured\n",
      "electricity for some extended period at a specified tariff.\n",
      "\n",
      "37\\. For the aforestated reasons, in our opinion, the respondent-State was not\n",
      "wholly fair when it extended benefit to the appellants only for the period\n",
      "during which electricity supply was reduced to less than 50% on certain days.\n",
      "\n",
      "38\\. We, therefore, hold that the benefit extended by the respondent State is\n",
      "not sufficient. The respondent-State ought to have extended the period even\n",
      "for the days when supply of electricity was more than 50% but not 100% as\n",
      "assured under G.O. dated 21.5.1990 and 6.2.1992. We, therefore, direct the\n",
      "respondents to give the said benefit by extending the period of incentive.\n",
      "\n",
      "39\\. We, therefore, allow the appeals by quashing and setting aside the\n",
      "impugned order passed by the High Court and direct the respondents to\n",
      "calculate the period during which 100% electricity supply was not given to the\n",
      "appellants and extend the period of incentive accordingly. The calculation\n",
      "shall be made and consequential orders shall be passed within two months from\n",

      "provisions under the Evidence Act relevant to the issue under discussion.\n",

      "In the Statement of Objects and Reasons to the IT Act, it is stated thus:\n",

      "“New communication systems and digital technology have made drastic changes in\n",
      "the way we live. A revolution is occurring in the way people transact\n",
      "business.” In fact, there is a revolution in the way the evidence is produced\n",
      "before the court. Properly guided, it makes the systems function faster and\n",
      "more effective. The guidance relevant to the issue before us is reflected in\n",
      "the statutory provisions extracted above.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any documentary evidence by way of an electronic record under the Evidence\n",
      "Act, in view of Sections 59 and 65A, can be proved only in accordance with the\n",
      "procedure prescribed under Section 65B. Section 65B deals with the\n",
      "admissibility of the electronic record. The purpose of these provisions is to\n",
      "sanctify secondary evidence in electronic form, generated by a computer.\n",

      "Section 65B(2). Following are the specified conditions under Section 65B(2) of\n",
      "the Evidence Act:\n",
      "\n",
      "(i) The electronic record containing the information should have been produced\n",
      "by the computer during the period over which the same was regularly used to\n",
      "store or process information for the purpose of any activity regularly carried\n",
      "on over that period by the person having lawful control over the use of that\n",
      "computer;\n",

      "(ii) The information of the kind contained in electronic record or of the kind\n",
      "from which the information is derived was regularly fed into the computer in\n",
      "the ordinary course of the said activity;\n",
      "\n",
      "(iii) During the material part of the said period, the computer was operating\n",
      "properly and that even if it was not operating properly for some time, the\n",
      "break or breaks had not affected either the record or the accuracy of its\n",
      "contents; and (iv) The information contained in the record should be a\n",
      "reproduction or derivation from the information fed into the computer in the\n",
      "ordinary course of the said activity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under Section 65B(4) of the Evidence Act, if it is desired to give a statement\n",
      "in any proceedings pertaining to an electronic record, it is permissible\n",
      "provided the following conditions are satisfied:\n",
      "\n",
      "(a) There must be a certificate which identifies the electronic record\n",
      "containing the statement;\n",
      "\n",
      "(b) The certificate must describe the manner in which the electronic record\n",
      "was produced;\n",

      "(c) The certificate must furnish the particulars of the device involved in the\n",
      "production of that record;\n",

      "(d) The certificate must deal with the applicable conditions mentioned under\n",
      "Section 65B(2) of the Evidence Act; and (e) The certificate must be signed by\n",
      "a person occupying a responsible official position in relation to the\n",
      "operation of the relevant device.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is further clarified that the person need only to state in the certificate\n",
      "that the same is to the best of his knowledge and belief. Most importantly,\n",
      "such a certificate must accompany the electronic record like computer\n",
      "printout, Compact Disc (CD), Video Compact Disc (VCD), pen drive, etc.,\n",
      "pertaining to which a statement is sought to be given in evidence, when the\n",
      "same is produced in evidence. All these safeguards are taken to ensure the\n",
      "source and authenticity, which are the two hallmarks pertaining to electronic\n",
      "record sought to be used as evidence. Electronic records being more\n",
      "susceptible to tampering, alteration, transposition, excision, etc. without\n",
      "such safeguards, the whole trial based on proof of electronic records can lead\n",
      "to travesty of justice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only if the electronic record is duly produced in terms of Section 65B of the\n",
      "Evidence Act, the question would arise as to the genuineness thereof and in\n",
      "that situation, resort can be made to Section 45A – opinion of examiner of\n",
      "electronic evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Evidence Act does not contemplate or permit the proof of an electronic\n",
      "record by oral evidence if requirements under Section 65B of the Evidence Act\n",
      "are not complied with, as the law now stands in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is relevant to note that Section 69 of the Police and Criminal Evidence\n",
      "Act, 1984 (PACE) dealing with evidence on computer records in the United\n",
      "Kingdom was repealed by Section 60 of the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence\n",
      "Act, 1999. Computer evidence hence must follow the common law rule, where a\n",
      "presumption exists that the computer producing the evidential output was\n",
      "recording properly at the material time. The presumption can be rebutted if\n",
      "evidence to the contrary is adduced. In the United States of America, under\n",
      "Federal Rule of Evidence, reliability of records normally go to the weight of\n",
      "evidence and not to admissibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "Proof of electronic record is a special provision introduced by the IT Act\n",
      "amending various provisions under the Evidence Act. The very caption of\n",
      "Section 65A of the Evidence Act, read with Sections 59 and 65B is sufficient\n",
      "to hold that the special provisions on evidence relating to electronic record\n",
      "shall be governed by the procedure prescribed under Section 65B of the\n",
      "Evidence Act. That is a complete code in itself. Being a special law, the\n",
      "general law under Sections 63 and 65 has to yield.\n",
      "\n",
      "In State (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu alias Afsan Guru[1], a two-Judge\n",
      "Bench of this Court had an occasion to consider an issue on production of\n",
      "electronic record as evidence. While considering the printouts of the\n",
      "computerized records of the calls pertaining to the cellphones, it was held at\n",
      "Paragraph-150 as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "“150. According to Section 63, secondary evidence means and includes, among\n",
      "other things, “copies made from the original by mechanical processes which in\n",
      "themselves insure the accuracy of the copy, and copies compared with such\n",
      "copies”. Section 65 enables secondary evidence of the contents of a document\n",
      "to be adduced if the original is of such a nature as not to be easily movable.\n",
      "It is not in dispute that the information contained in the call records is\n",
      "stored in huge servers which cannot be easily moved and produced in the court.\n",
      "That is what the High Court has also observed at para 276. Hence, printouts\n",
      "taken from the computers/servers by mechanical process and certified by a\n",
      "responsible official of the service-providing company can be led in evidence\n",
      "through a witness who can identify the signatures of the certifying officer or\n",
      "otherwise speak of the facts based on his personal knowledge. Irrespective of\n",
      "the compliance with the requirements of Section 65-B, which is a provision\n",
      "dealing with admissibility of electronic records, there is no bar to adducing\n",
      "secondary evidence under the other provisions of the Evidence Act, namely,\n",
      "Sections 63 and 65. It may be that the certificate containing the details in\n",
      "sub- section (4) of Section 65-B is not filed in the instant case, but that\n",
      "does not mean that secondary evidence cannot be given even if the law permits\n",
      "such evidence to be given in the circumstances mentioned in the relevant\n",
      "provisions, namely, Sections 63 and 65.” It may be seen that it was a case\n",
      "where a responsible official had duly certified the document at the time of\n",
      "production itself. The signatures in the certificate were also identified.\n",
      "That is apparently in compliance with the procedure prescribed under Section\n",
      "65B of the Evidence Act. However, it was held that irrespective of the\n",
      "compliance with the requirements of Section 65B, which is a special provision\n",
      "dealing with admissibility of the electronic record, there is no bar in\n",
      "adducing secondary evidence, under Sections 63 and 65, of an electronic\n",

      "has been committed by a returned candidate or his election agent or by any\n",
      "other person with the consent of a returned candidate or his election agent”.\n",
      "In other words, the corrupt practice must be committed by (i) returned\n",

      "since there is no evidence to prove that the printing and publication of\n",
      "Exhibit-P1-leaflet was made with the consent of the first respondent or his\n",
      "election agent, the sixth respondent. Though it was vehemently contended by\n",
      "the appellant that the printing and publication was made with the connivance\n",
      "of the first respondent and hence consent should be inferred, we are afraid,\n",
      "the same cannot be appreciated. ‘Connivance’ is different from ‘consent’.\n",
      "According to the Concise Oxford English Dictionary, ‘connive’ means to\n",
      "secretly allow a wrong doing where as ‘consent’ is permission. The proof\n",
      "required is of consent for the publication and not connivance on publication.\n",

      "necessarily means or amounts to consent, that is to say, irrespective of the\n",
      "context of the given situation. The two cannot, therefore, be equated. Consent\n",
      "implies that parties are ad idem. Connivance does not necessarily imply that\n",
      "parties are of one mind. They may or may not be, depending upon the facts of\n",
      "the situation. …” Learned Counsel for the appellant vehemently contends that\n",
      "consent needs to be inferred from the circumstances. No doubt, on charges\n",
      "relating to commission of corrupt practices, direct proof on consent is very\n",
      "difficult.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consent is to be inferred from the circumstances as held by this Court in\n",
      "Sheopat Singh v. Harish Chandra and another[3]. The said view has been\n",
      "consistently followed thereafter. However, if an inference on consent from the\n",
      "circumstances is to be drawn, the circumstances put together should form a\n",
      "chain which should lead to a reasonable conclusion that the candidate or his\n",
      "agent has given the consent for publication of the objectionable material.\n",
      "Question is whether such clear, cogent and credible evidence is available so\n",
      "as to lead to a reasonable conclusion on the consent of the first respondent\n",
      "on the alleged publication of Exhibit-P1- leaflet. As we have also discussed\n",
      "above, there is no evidence at all to prove that Exhibit-P1-leaflet was\n",
      "printed at the instance of the first respondent. One Haseeb, who placed the\n",
      "order for printing of Exhibit-P1 is not examined. Shri Hamza, who is said to\n",
      "be the Manager of the Press at the relevant time, was not examined. Shri\n",
      "Mustafa, who is said to have told the appellant that the expenses for the\n",

      "examined. No evidence of the electoral returns pertaining to the expenditure\n",
      "on printing of Exhibit-P1 by the first respondent is available. The allegation\n",
      "in the election petition is on printing of 25,000 copies of Exhibit-P1. The\n",
      "evidence available on record is only with regard to printing of 1,000 copies.\n",
      "According to PW-24- Sajid, 21 bundles of Exhibit-P1 were kept in the house of\n",
      "first respondent as directed by wife of the first respondent. She is also not\n",
      "examined. It is significant to note that Sajid’s version, as above, is not the\n",

      "denied of any such material like Exhibit-P1 being transported by him in the\n",

      "has a case that the copies of Exhibit-P1 were taken from the house of the\n",
      "first respondent. Their only case is that the vehicles were coming from the\n",

      "copies. PW-4 has denied it. It is also interesting to note that PW-9-Faizal\n",
      "has stated in evidence that he was disclosing the same for the first time in\n",
      "court regarding the receipt of notice from PW-4. It is also relevant to note\n",
      "that in Annexure-P3- complaint filed by the chief electoral agent of the\n",
      "appellant on 13.04.2011, there is no reference to the number of copies of\n",
      "Exhibit-P1- leaflet, days when the same were distributed and the people who\n",
      "distributed the same, etc., and most importantly, there is no allegation at\n",
      "all in Annexure-P3 that the said leaflet was printed by the first respondent\n",
      "or with his consent. The only allegation is on knowledge and connivance on the\n",
      "part of the first respondent. We have already held that knowledge and\n",
      "connivance is different from consent. Consent is the requirement for\n",
      "constituting corrupt practice under Section 123(4) of the RP Act. In such\n",
      "circumstances, it cannot be said that there is a complete chain of\n",
      "circumstances which would lead to a reasonable inference on consent by the\n",
      "first respondent with regard to printing of Exhibit-P1-leaflet. Not only that\n",
      "there are missing links, the evidence available is also not cogent and\n",
      "credible on the consent aspect of first respondent.\n",

      "1974, is the Petitioners argued that the aforesaid impugned\n",
      "provisions/conditions comprised in the aforesaid clause 4(bb) and clause (13)\n",
      "amount to an unreasonable restriction on the petitioners' fundamental freedom\n",
      "to carry on trade or business in Kendu leaves; guaranteed under Article\n",

      "protection of sub-clause (ii) in the second part of clause (6) of Article 19\n",
      "because the impugned provisions are not \"integrally and essentially connected\"\n",
      "with the creation of the monopoly in favour of the State, but are only\n",
      "incidental or subsidiary to the operation of the monopoly.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "State of Orissa and Rashbihari Panda etc. v. State of Orissa.\n",

      "The second proposition propounded by Mr. Nariman is that the impugned\n",
      "provisions violate the fundamental rights of the petitioners' guaranteed under\n",
      "Article 14 of the Constitution, because in their immediate operation and\n",
      "effect, they are harsh, unconscionable, arbitrary unfair and oppressive; that\n",
      "even where the quantity offered to the purchaser is far less than 75% of the\n",
      "notified estimated yield, or the leaves offered are not of merchantable\n",
      "quality, the impugned provisions unreasonably obligate the purchaser to pay\n",
      "royalty for 75 per cent of the estimated yield irrespective of whether the\n",
      "shortfall in the quantity 428 offered/delivered or the unmerchantable quality\n",
      "of the leaves offered is due to the fraud or negligence of the Agent who,\n",
      "under the Rules, is supposed to be independent of the purchaser and under the\n",
      "exclusive control of the Government; that the impugned provisions operate\n",
      "irrationally and unfairly as they make no discerning distinction between\n",
      "honest purchasers who are not blamable for the shortfall and dishonest\n",
      "purchasers who through their fraud or collusion with the agent or officers of\n",
      "the Government contribute to the shortfall. Thus, the impugned provisions tar\n",
      "honest and dishonest purchasers with one and the same brush which results in\n",
      "procrustean cruelty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, the impugned provision which forecloses the right of the purchaser to\n",
      "refuse delivery on the ground of the leaves offered, not being of requisite\n",
      "quality, is inconsistent with and ultra vires of the Proviso to Section 9(1)\n",

      "Dr. Chitale, appearing for the petitioners in Writ Petitions 121 to 125 of\n",

      "attention to Annexure 'C' to Writ Petition 47 of 1975, wherein quite a large\n",
      "number of instances are given to show that the shortfall in the actual\n",
      "delivery of the Kendu leaves to the purchasers as against the estimated yield\n",
      "is considerable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Learned counsel has emphasised that the auctions are held in January, while\n",
      "the Agents are not appointed till March or April, which is the plucking\n",
      "season, and in January, no reasonable estimate of the expected yield is\n",
      "possible. It is maintained that the allegations in the counter-affidavit filed\n",
      "on behalf of the State to the effect, that the purchasers inspect the units\n",
      "and make their own estimates of the expected yield is factually incorrect\n",
      "because in January no such estimate is possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Dewan, who has appeared for some of the petitioners, cited Maneka Gandhi's\n",
      "case in support of his contention, that the impugned provisions in their\n",
      "direct and inevitable effect, impinge upon the fundamental rights of the\n",
      "petitioners guaranteed under Articles 14 and 19(1) (g) of the Constitution.\n",
      "Learned counsel contrasted the impugned provisions with the Rules in vogue in\n",

      "\n",
      "Mr. K. S. Sinha, appearing for the appellant in Criminal Appeal 300 of 1974,\n",
      "submitted that the validity of the impugned provisions was indirectly involved\n",
      "in this appeal, though in a different context. It is pointed out that the\n",
      "permit to remove the leaves was refused to 429 the appellant on the ground\n",
      "that he had taken away the leaves without paying 75 per cent of the royalty\n",
      "and had contravened Rule 16. The point sought to be made out is that if the\n",
      "impugned Rules are not held to be valid, this appeal must, in consequence,\n",
      "succeed.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, Mr. L. N. Sinha, learned Attorney- General submits on\n",
      "behalf of the respondents that there is a paucity of skilled people who could\n",
      "be employed as Agents;\n",
      "\n",
      "that in actual practice the persons appointed as Agents are sponsored by the\n",
      "purchasers.\n",
      "\n",
      "(i) It is submitted that the terms of the Agreement, taken as a whole, are not\n",
      "one-sided. Whereas under the conditions of the Tender Notice and the Agreement\n",
      "the purchasers voluntarily bind themselves to pay the full price of the unit\n",
      "which is fixed according to the Rules, irrespective of any shortfall in the\n",
      "quantity offered and delivered, they, under the terms of the same Agreement\n",
      "get the benefit of purchasing Kendu leaves offered in excess of 75 per cent of\n",
      "the estimated yield at the concessional rate of 55 per cent only of the\n",
      "purchase price. It is argued that if the conditions of the Tender Notice and\n",
      "the statutory Agreement are considered as a whole, it is evident that the\n",
      "risks of loss and chances of benefit are equally divided between the\n",
      "purchasers and the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "(ii) It is stressed that what is sold at the time of auction is the estimated\n",
      "produce from a unit, as such, and the highest bidder or tenderer gets the\n",
      "contract to purchase that unit at a price the minimum of which is fixed at 75%\n",
      "of the amount arrived at by multiplying the notified estimated yield in terms\n",
      "of standard bags from that unit. It is urged that (if a person voluntarily\n",
      "takes upon himself under the terms of a contract, such risks and chances of\n",
      "benefit, he has no right in the event of suffering a loss to be compensated\n",
      "for it even under the ordinary law in a suit, much less the Court of writ\n",
      "jurisdiction can grant him any such relief). It is pointed out that actually,\n",
      "in 110 out of 1000 units, that yield exceeded in the notified estimates, and\n",
      "as a result, the purchasers reaped full benefit of the excess supply at\n",
      "concessional rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "(iii) (a) It is emphasised that the liability of the petitioners to pay the\n",
      "whole price for the unit arises from the contract and, as such, it cannot be\n",
      "considered to have a direct impact on the fundamental right of the petitioners\n",
      "to carry on their trade or business; that the right to enter into a contract\n",
      "on particular terms with the State is not a fundamental right. Even this\n",
      "Court-proceeds the argument- cannot reconstruct the terms and conditions\n",
      "voluntarily agreed between the petitioners and the State.\n",
      "\n",
      "430 (iii) (b) It is argued that it is not a fit case to be decided under\n",
      "Article 32 of the Constitution, because in several of these petitions the\n",
      "purchasers (petitioners) were in default, inasmuch as they did not pay the\n",
      "amounts required to be adjusted against the remuneration of the Agents; that\n",
      "in most of the cases the purchasers reaped that full benefits of the contract\n",
      "and only in stray cases, they suffered loss; that since they had availed of\n",
      "the chance of reaping and advantage, they could not turn round and attack the\n",
      "validity of the terms and conditions of the contract which they had\n",
      "voluntarily made and worked out.\n",

      "the quantity actually delivered, the risk of loss or leakage of public revenue\n",
      "by reason of fraud and collusion between the purchasers and the agents will\n",
      "manifestly increase. Looked at from this angle also, against the real factual\n",
      "background, the impugned Condition 13 cannot be said to be unreasonable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Nariman contended that if the factual position, as stated in the counter-\n",
      "affidavit filed on behalf of the State, is correct, then the impugned\n",
      "condition 13 will be hit by the ratio of this Court's decisions in Rashbihari\n",
      "Panda etc. v. State of Orissa (ibid) and Akadasi Padhan's case (ibid), because\n",

      "\n",
      "In order to appreciate this contention, it is necessary to notice Rashbihari\n",
      "Panda's case. To regulate trade in Kendu leaves and prevent exploitation of\n",
      "growers and pluckers, the State of Orissa enacted 436 the Orissa Kendu Leaves\n",
      "(Control of Trade) Act. 1961. By Section 3 of that Act, which is analogous to\n",
      "Section 3 of the Bihar Act, no person other than the Government, an authorised\n",
      "officer of the Government, or an agent appointed by the Government, is\n",
      "entitled to purchase or transport Kendu leaves; and under Section 4 of that\n",

      "In Akadasi Padhan's case (ibid), a grower of Kendu leaves challenged Sections\n",
      "3 and 4 and Rule 7(5) made under that Act on the ground that it contravened\n",
      "his fundamental right under Articles 14 and 19(1)(a) and (g) in this Court. It\n",
      "was held that Sections 3 and 4 did not infringe Article 19(6) (ii), but the\n",
      "State Government was incompetent to implement the provisions of the Act and\n",
      "give effect to its monopoly, because the agents appointed were not really\n",
      "agents of the Government but were authorised to carry on trade in the leaves\n",
      "purchased not on behalf of the Government but on their own account, and that\n",
      "it thus gave rise to a monopoly in favour of the agents which was not\n",
      "protected by Article 19(6) (ii) since the law cannot be used by the State for\n",
      "the private benefit of agents. After the decision in Akadasi Padhan's case,\n",
      "the Orissa State made some changes in the implementation of its monopoly. In\n",
      "1966, it invited tenders from persons desirous of purchasing Kendu leaves\n",
      "purchased by the officers and agents of the Government. During the years 1966\n",
      "and 1967, the prices of Kendu leaves ruled very high and when sales were\n",
      "effected by public auction, prices considerably in excess of those at which\n",
      "tenders were accepted were realised. Early in 1968, the State evolved another\n",
      "scheme under which, it offered to renew the licences of those traders who in\n",
      "the State's view had worked satisfactorily in the previous year and had paid\n",
      "the amounts due from them regularly. The scheme was objected to, and realising\n",
      "that, the scheme arbitrarily excluded many persons interested in the trade,\n",
      "and hence was objectionable, the Government decided to invite offers for\n",
      "advance purchases of Kendu leaves but restricted the invitation to those\n",
      "individuals who had carried out the contracts in the previous year without\n",
      "default and to the satisfaction of the Government that is, the existing\n",
      "contractors were given the exclusive right to make offers to purchase Kendu\n",
      "leaves.\n",
      "\n",
      "This new method of offering to enter into agreements for advance purchases of\n",
      "Kendu leaves by private offers in preference to open competition, was\n",
      "challenged by writ petitions in the High Court as 437 violative of the\n",
      "petitioner's fundamental rights under Articles 14 and 19(1) (g).\n",
      "\n",
      "Reversing the decision of the High Court, this Court, in appeal, held, The\n",

      "therefrom is to enure to the State, and the monopoly is not used as a cloak\n",
      "for conferring private benefit upon a limited class of persons. The monopoly\n",
      "of purchasing Kendu leaves under Section 3 may be held to be valid if, it be\n",
      "administered only for the benefit of the State. Similarly, the right to sell\n",
      "or dispose of Kendu leaves by the State under Section 10, in such manner as\n",

      "emphasises the concept that the machinery of sale or disposal of the leaves\n",
      "must also be geared to serve the public interest. If the scheme of disposal\n",
      "creates a class of middlemen who could purchase from the Government at\n",

      "Government to exercise the scheme of the Bihar Act and the Rules and Forms\n",
      "framed or prescribed thereunder, of the vices from which the schemes of Orissa\n",
      "Legislation suffered. This will be clear from a comparative study of the\n",
      "Orissa schemes and the Bihar scheme. Firstly, under the Orissa schemes, the\n",
      "monopoly was not being worked for the entire benefit of the State or in the\n",
      "general public interest, but was being used as a cloak for conferring private\n",
      "benefit upon a limited class of persons. The offers for purchasing Kendu\n",
      "leaves were restricted to a particular class of contractors and were not open\n",
      "to the general public. This vice does not exist in the Bihar scheme including\n",
      "the scheme of the impugned provisions. The notified estimate annual yield for\n",
      "a unit or units is sold either by inviting tenders from the public by\n",
      "publishing a Tender Notice or by public auction after a similar notice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any person who wants to carry on the business of purchasing Kendu leaves for\n",
      "the purpose of manufacture of Bidis is entitled to submit his offer in the\n",
      "prescribed Tender Form in response to the public notice inviting tenders, or\n",
      "offer his bid at the auction, if the disposal is by public 439 auction.\n",
      "Secondly, the scheme of disposal envisaged by the impugned provisions of the\n",
      "Orissa Act and the Orissa rules created a class of middlemen who could\n",
      "purchase from the Government at concessional rates and earn large profits\n",
      "disproportionate to the service rendered or duty performed by them. In\n",
      "contrast with this, the Bihar scheme in question does not operate to create\n",
      "any monopoly in favour of any particular class of purchasers. Nor does the\n",
      "Bihar scheme enable the purchasers to make unduly large profits at the cost of\n",
      "the public revenue or others. Even if the agents, in actual practice, are\n",
      "persons sponsored by the purchasers, then also, the rules framed under the\n",
      "Bihar Act envisage a strict and exclusive control of the Government over the\n",
      "Agents and their activities, and provide for their liability to compensate the\n",
      "Government for the loss occasioned by their misconduct or neglect. Under the\n",
      "impugned Condition 13, the minimum price payable for the unit or units\n",
      "concerned by a purchaser is 75 per cent of the notified estimated yield from\n",
      "that unit or units, in terms of standard bags multiplied by the rates or bid\n",
      "offered by the purchaser and accepted by the Government, even if the actual\n",
      "yield from that unit or units falls short of 75 per cent of the estimated\n",
      "yield. This condition far from creating a monopoly in the trade in favour of\n",
      "middlemen, operates as an ironclad safeguard against leakage of the public\n",
      "revenue by assuring a minimum return to the public exchequer from the sale of\n",
      "Kendu leaves. The provision is aimed to secure the full benefit from the trade\n",
      "to the State leaving chances of making reasonable, marginal profit to the\n",
      "purchasers.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was observed in Rashbihari's case, that it would be in the interest of\n",
      "State to invite tenders in the open market from all persons irrespective of\n",
      "their having taken contracts in the previous year. This suggestion has been\n",
      "adopted by the scheme of the Bihar Act and the Rules and the Forms of Tender\n",
      "Notice and Agreement prescribed thereunder.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some other defects pointed out by this Court in the operation of the Orissa\n",
      "schemes, were that the Government had not estimated the crop and the\n",
      "prevailing prices of Kendu leaves about the time when offers were made, nor\n",
      "the conditions in the market, nor offers of higher prices and the likelihood\n",
      "of offerers of higher prices carrying out their obligations. The scheme of the\n",
      "Bihar Act and the Rules, and Forms including that of the impugned condition 13\n",
      "is designed to remove the deficiencies, infirmities and vices pointed out by\n",
      "this Court in Rashbihari's case.\n",
      "\n",
      "For these reasons, we are unable to accept the contention, that in actual\n",
      "operation, the impugned provision (clause 13) creates a monopoly in favour of\n",
      "a class of middlemen consisting of `Agents' and pur- 440 chasers, and enables\n",
      "them to earn unduly large profits at the cost of the public or pluckers and\n",
      "growers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The impugned Condition 13 satisfies the test of reasonableness under the first\n",
      "part of Article 19(6). We, therefore, repel the challenge to the validity of\n",
      "that condition on the ground of Article 19(6).\n",
      "\n",
      "The next question is whether the impugned provisions are violative of the\n",
      "fundamental rights of the petitioners under Article 14 of the Constitution.\n",
      "The argument is that these provisions treat unequals as equals, even where\n",
      "crying dissimilarities exist and thus their operation results in Procrustean\n",
      "cruelty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The point sought to be made out is that even if the shortfall in the quantity\n",
      "supplied or the substandard nature of the quality offered to the purchaser is\n",
      "solely due to the fraud, negligence or misconduct of the Agent or servant of\n",
      "the Government, the loss due to such shortfall or deficiency in quality must\n",
      "fall on the purchaser, notwithstanding the fact that he (purchaser) was in no\n",
      "way privy or contributory to that fraud, negligence or misconduct of the Agent\n",
      "or Government servant and thus the impugned provisions do not make any\n",
      "discerning distinction between honest purchasers and dishonest purchasers, but\n",
      "tar those dissimilarly situated classes with one and the same brush. The\n",
      "argument though attractive, does not stand a close examination.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the time of inviting Tenders in the prescribed Form or inviting purchasers\n",
      "to bid at the publication, all tenderers or bidders are treated equally in the\n",
      "sense that they can offer their rates or bids subject to the statutory\n",
      "conditions including the impugned provisions. While accepting the highest\n",
      "Tender of rates per standard bag or the highest bid, it is not possible to\n",
      "classify the purchasers whose offers/bids have been accepted into `honest'\n",
      "purchasers and `dishonest' purchasers. Everybody whose offer or bid is\n",
      "accepted, is assumed to be honest.\n",
      "\n",
      "Secondly, in entering into a contract of purchase of the notified estimated\n",
      "yield in terms of standard bags, the discretion and volition of the tenderer\n",
      "or bidder, also, plays an important part in calculating the minimum price\n",
      "payable for the estimated yield from the particular unit.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the impugned Condition 13 of the Tender Notice, which also forms\n",
      "a part of the prescribed Form in which tenders are invited, the successful\n",
      "tenderer or bidder whose tender or bid is accepted by the Department, has to\n",
      "pay a minimum royalty, also described as `revenue' or price, which will be 75\n",
      "per cent of the notified estimated yield in terms of standard bag by the\n",
      "tenderer or bidder.\n",
      "\n",
      "441 Thus, the volition of the purchaser also plays a prominent part in fixing\n",
      "the rate or price payable by him. By means of his offer in the Tender Form or\n",
      "by bidding at the auction, the purchaser binds himself to pay this minimum\n",
      "royalty even if by the end of the year, the number of bags collected is less\n",
      "than the notified estimated yield. The purchasers form their own estimates of\n",
      "the expected yield from a particular unit for a particular year and then make\n",
      "their offers of rates in the prescribed Tender Form, or when the disposal is\n",
      "by public auction, the purchasers make their bids subject to the terms\n",
      "published in the Tender or Auction Notices. If, according to the estimate of\n",
      "an intending purchaser, the unit concerned is not likely to yield the quantity\n",
      "notified, it is open to him either not to submit any tender or offer or rates\n",
      "at all, or not to offer a bid or an amount higher than that which, according\n",
      "to his own estimate or calculation, would be a reasonable price of the\n",
      "bargain. In other words, if a person with his eyes open tenders the highest\n",
      "rates per standard bag or offers the highest bid at public auction, as the\n",
      "case may be, of his own accord, it will be assumed that he did so because in\n",
      "his own estimation the acceptance of the contract at those rates and subject\n",
      "to the notified terms and condition would afford him a reasonable scope for\n",
      "making profit. Furthermore, under the scheme of the Bihar Act and Rules, the\n",
      "sale is not restricted to any particular class of persons as in Rashbiharis\n",
      "case. Anyone who wants to do business of purchase of Kendu leaves can submit\n",
      "his tender of rates in the prescribed Form, or offer his bid at the auction,\n",
      "as the case may be, subject to the notified conditions of the Tender\n",

      "It is a fundamental principle of general application that if a person of his\n",
      "own accord, accepts a contract on certain terms and works out the contract, he\n",
      "cannot be allowed to adhere to and abide by some of the terms of the contract\n",
      "which proved advantageous to him and repudiate the other terms of the same\n",
      "contract which might be disadvantageous to him. The maxim is qui approbat non\n",
      "reprobat, (one who approbates cannot reprobate). This principle, though\n",
      "originally borrowed from Scots Law, is now firmly embodied in English Common\n",
      "Law. According to it, a party to an instrument or transaction cannot take\n",
      "advantage of one part of a document or transaction and reject the rest. That\n",
      "is to say, no party can accept and reject the same instrument or transaction\n",
      "(Per Scrutton L.J. Verschures Creameries, Ltd. v. Hull & Netherlands Steamship\n",
      "Co.; See Douglas Menzies v. Umphelby; See also Stroud's Judicial Dictionary,\n",
      "Vol. I, page 169, 3rd Edn.).\n",
      "\n",
      "442 The aforesaid inhibitory principle squarely applies to the cases of those\n",
      "petitioners who had by offering highest bids at public auctions or by Tenders,\n",
      "accepted and worked out the contracts in the past but are now resisting the\n",
      "demands or other action, arising out of the impugned Condition 13 on the\n",
      "ground that this condition is violative of Articles 19(1)(g) and 14 of the\n",
      "Constitution. In this connection, it will bear repetition, here, that the\n",
      "impugned conditions though bear a statutory complexion, retain their basic\n",
      "contractual character, also. It is true that a person cannot be debarred from\n",
      "enforcing his fundamental rights on the ground of estoppel or waiver. But the\n",
      "aforesaid principle which prohibits a party to a transaction from approbating,\n",
      "a part of its conditions and reprobating the rest, is different from the\n",
      "doctrine of estoppel or waiver).\n",
      "\n",
      "For the foregoing reasons, the challenge to the impugned Condition No. 13, on\n",
      "the ground of Article 14, also, is unsustainable and is rejected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, we take up the impugned Condition 4(bb). It provides that no objection\n",
      "from the purchaser with regard to the quantity or quality of the leave in the\n",
      "gaddis (bundles) offered would be tenable. This condition is couched in\n",
      "peremptory, drastic and absolute language. It is not qualified by any words\n",
      "showing that the bar envisaged in it will be attracted only in cases where the\n",
      "purchaser has had an earlier opportunity to raise this objection but failed to\n",
      "do so, or, where he had on an earlier occasion raised such an objection which\n",
      "was heard and overruled by the competent Forest Officer. We have already\n",
      "noticed that Section 9(1), proviso, of the Act contains a built-in-warranty,\n",
      "that the Kendu leaves offered would be fit for manufacture of bidis;\n",
      "\n",
      "that is to say, the leaves would be of merchantable quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Condition 4(bb) therefore, is inconsistent with and repugnant to Section 9(1),\n",
      "proviso of the Act and, as such, invalid. It is, therefore, not necessary to\n",

      "separate compensation could be awarded for the trees. However, the High Court\n",
      "did not disturb the compensation that had been awarded by the LAO for the\n",
      "trees and the well, apparently in view of section 25 of the Act which provides\n",
      "that the amount awarded by the Collector as compensation cannot be reduced by\n",

      "additional compensation of `3,62,971/- towards the trees and ` 1500/- towards\n",

      "a case, the Reference Court gets the jurisdiction to determine only the market\n",
      "value in regard to the land and not in regard to the building and trees, is\n",

      "the Reference Court that the compensation awarded by the Land Acquisition\n",

      "land, and things attached to the earth or permanently fastened to anything\n",
      "attached to the earth. Therefore when the Act refers to acquisition of `land',\n",

      "Acquisition Collector and the Reference Court in the context of making a\n",
      "reference and determining the compensation, we are of the view that once the\n",
      "reference is made in regard to amount of compensation, the Reference Court\n",
      "will have complete jurisdiction to decide the compensation for the land,\n",
      "buildings and trees and other appurtenances. The Reference Court will also\n",
      "have the power to entertain any application for increasing the compensation\n",

      "way of the landowner seeking increase even in regard to trees or structures,\n",
      "before the Reference Court.\n",
      "\n",
      "19\\. We are conscious of the fact that the State of Maharashtra has a special\n",
      "provision in the Bombay Court Fees Act, 1959 (Entry 15 in Schedule I) which\n",
      "requires every claimant who makes an application to the Collector for a\n",
      "reference to court under section 18 of the Act to pay one half the ad valorem\n",
      "fee on the difference between the amount awarded by the Collector and the\n",
      "amount claimed by the claimant. Thus the application under section 18\n",
      "objecting to the compensation by implication is required to disclose the\n",
      "amount of compensation sought and pay court fee on the increase sought. But\n",
      "this is only a requirement in regard to the Court Fees Act. This only means\n",
      "that if the claim is amended later, additional court fee may have to be paid.\n",
      "This requirement under the Court Fees Act cannot be read as a requirement\n",
      "under the Land Acquisition Act. So long as Land Acquisition Act is not amended\n",

      "\n",
      "21\\. The High Court has also held that once the compensation is awarded for\n",
      "the land, there cannot be additional or separate compensation for the trees.\n",
      "For this purpose, the High Court has relied upon the following observations of\n",
      "this Court in State of Haryana vs. Gurcharan Singh - 1995 Supp (2) SCC 637 :\n",
      "\"It is settled law that the Collector or the court who determines the\n",
      "compensation for the land as well as fruit bearing trees cannot determine them\n",
      "separately. The compensation is to the value of the acquired land. The market\n",
      "value is determined on the basis of the yield. Then necessarily applying\n",
      "suitable multiplier, the compensation needs to be awarded. Under no\n",
      "circumstances the court should allow the compensation on the basis of the\n",
      "nature of the land as well as fruit- bearing trees. In other words, market\n",
      "value of the land is determined twice over; once on the basis of the value of\n",
      "the land and again on the basis of the yield got from the fruit-bearing trees.\n",
      "The definition of land includes the benefits which accrue from the land as\n",
      "defined in section 3(a) of the Act. After compensation is determined on the\n",
      "basis of the value of the land as distinct from the income applying suitable\n",
      "multiplier, then the trees would be valued only as firewood and necessary\n",
      "compensation would be given.\" 2\n",
      "\n",
      "22\\. We are afraid that the High Court has misread the said decision in regard\n",
      "of valuing the land and trees separately. If the land value had been\n",
      "determined with reference to the sale statistics or compensation awarded for a\n",
      "nearby vacant land, then necessarily, the trees will have to be valued\n",
      "separately. But if the value of the land has been determined on the basis of\n",
      "the sale statistics or compensation awarded for an orchard, that is land with\n",
      "fruit-bearing trees, then there is no question of again adding the value of\n",
      "the trees. Further, if the market value has been determined by capitalizing\n",
      "the income with reference to yield, then also the question of making any\n",
      "addition either for the land or for the trees separately does not arise. In\n",
      "this case, the determination of market value was not with reference to the\n",
      "yield. Nor was the determination of market value in regard to the land with\n",
      "reference to the value of any orchard but was with reference to vacant\n",
      "agricultural land. In the circumstances, the value of the trees could be added\n",
      "to the value of the land. A suggestion to the State Government 2\n",
      "\n",
      "23\\. In all other States, ad valorem court-fee is payable only when an appeal\n",
      "is filed against the award of the Reference Court, seeking higher compensation\n",
      "and not in regard to applications for reference under section 18 of LA Act.\n",
      "Only in Maharashtra and Gujarat, the land losers are required to pay half of\n",
      "the ad valorem court-fee while seeking reference to the civil court. Most of\n",
      "the land-losers are agriculturists. For many of them, the only source of\n",
      "livelihood is taken away by acquisition of their lands. Though, the Collector\n",
      "is expected to award compensation based on the market value, quite often, it\n",
      "is seen that in actual practice, the compensation offered by the Collector is\n",
      "far less than the actual market value, thereby forcing the land-losers to seek\n",
      "references to civil court. In such cases, the amount awarded by the Collector\n",
      "being comparatively small, the requirement to pay ad-valorem court-fee on the\n",
      "application for reference causes irreparable hardship, forcing the land loser\n",
      "to seek a lesser increase than what is warranted. The State Government may\n",
      "therefore consider giving appropriate relief to the land losers by providing\n",
      "for a nominal fixed court-fee, on the application for reference, instead of ad\n",
      "valorem court fee.\n",
      "\n",
      "24\\. We therefore allow this appeal, set aside the judgment dated 11.11.2008\n",
      "of the High Court, and remand the matter to the High Court for consideration\n",
      "of the 2 appeal on merits. As the matter relates to a 1970 acquisition and the\n",

      "4\\. As to the cause of the incident Harkesh stated that shortly before the\n",
      "occurrence his younger brother Suresh was elected as the village Sarpanch. He\n",
      "did not pay any heed to 3 the unreasonable demands of the accused and this\n",
      "greatly annoyed them as they thought of themselves as the Choudhary of the\n",
      "village. This had led to an altercation and an exchange of hot words between\n",
      "the two sides on the previous evening but the matter was then patched up by\n",

      "killed his brother Dinesh by giving him knife and lathi blows.\n",

      "deep, margins inverted.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "7\\. According to the post-mortem report, death was caused due to shock and\n",
      "hemorrhage as a result of injury no. 1 which was ante-mortem in nature and was\n",
      "sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of nature. Injuries Nos. 2, 3, 4\n",
      "were found to be post-mortem in nature. It was further stated that time\n",
      "elapsed between death and post-mortem was within 18 hours.\n",

      "accused named in the FIR and all of them were put on trial on charges under\n",
      "sections 148, 302, 324, 323 read 5 with section 149 and section 506 of the\n",
      "Penal Code. The appellant, Hari Kishan, was also charged under section 25 of\n",
      "the Arms Act for possession and unlawful use of the knife and was tried\n",
      "separately for that offence.\n",
      "\n",
      "9\\. In the main case the prosecution examined eight witnesses out of whom\n",
      "three, namely Harkesh (PW-2), Bhim Singh (PW-4) and Suresh Kumar (PW-6)\n",
      "claimed to be eye witnesses. Of the rest, Dr. Kishan Kumar (PW-3) was the\n",
      "doctor who had examined the injuries on the person of Harkesh and Kanti\n",
      "Prakash, Dr. Chandrika Malik (PW-5) was a member of the team of three doctors\n",
      "who had conducted post-mortem on the body of Dinesh, Bhoop Singh (PW-8) was\n",
      "the SHO Sadar Palwal PS who had recorded the statement of Harkesh and had\n",
      "investigated the case. The remaining two, Ashok Kumar (PW-1) and Ramesh Chand\n",
      "(PW-7) were formal witnesses. The prosecution also produced some documents and\n",
      "some material exhibits. The accused, of course, took the plea of false\n",
      "implication but they did not lead any evidence in their defence.\n",
      "\n",
      "10\\. On conclusion of trial, the trial court held the appellant Hari Kishan\n",
      "guilty of killing Dinesh by giving a knife blow on the left side of his chest\n",
      "and, accordingly, convicted him under section 302 and sentenced him to\n",
      "imprisonment for life and a fine of Rs.5000/- and in default in payment of\n",
      "fine, to a further period of imprisonment for one year. The trial court also\n",
      "convicted accused Shyam Lal, Nain Pal and Kanwar Pal under section 323 of the\n",
      "Penal Code 6 for causing simple injuries to Harkesh (PW-2) and his uncle Kanti\n",
      "Parkash and sentenced them to imprisonment for the period already undergone by\n",
      "them as under-trial and fine of Rs.1000/- each.\n",
      "\n",
      "11\\. What is, however, of significance for our purpose is that the trial court\n",
      "disbelieved a substantial part of the prosecution story. The trial court did\n",
      "not accept the prosecution case that accused Nathi and Roshan were present at\n",
      "the place of occurrence and, accordingly, directed their acquittal. As regards\n",
      "Rambir, the trial court pointed out that the three incised wounds on the\n",
      "person of the deceased that were attributed to him were, according to the\n",
      "medical evidence, post-mortem in nature, that is to say, those three injuries\n",
      "were inflicted after Dinesh was already dead. The medical evidence, thus,\n",
      "clearly eliminated the participation of Rambir in the case. He too was,\n",
      "therefore, acquitted. The acquittal of the three accused brought down the\n",
      "number of the remaining accused to less than five. Hence, the aid of section\n",
      "149 was no longer available to bring about the conviction of the remaining\n",
      "three accused Shyam Lal, Nain Pal and Kanwar Pal under section 302 for the\n",
      "shared common intention with the appellant Hari Kishan to kill Dinesh.\n",
      "Apparently, that was one of the reasons for their conviction simply under\n",
      "section 323.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trial court further disbelieved the prosecution case that Nain Pal and\n",
      "Kanwar Pal had given lathi bows to Dinesh on his back and observed that this\n",
      "part of the prosecution story was 7 an addition to rope in the two accused and\n",
      "to bring them within the mischief of section 149 of the Penal Code.\n",
      "\n",
      "12\\. Apart from the three accused whose presence at the place of occurrence\n",
      "was not accepted, the trial court also doubted the presence of two out of the\n",
      "three eye witnesses, namely Bhim Singh (PW-4) and Suresh Kumar (PW-6) at the\n",
      "time of occurrence. The trial court further held that even Harkesh (PW-2), the\n",
      "only remaining eye witness, had mixed-up truth with falsehood but his\n",
      "testimony was not liable to be discarded wholly since he had himself received\n",
      "injury in the same occurrence. In regard to the injury sustained by Harkesh,\n",
      "the trial court came to a truly amazing conclusion. It was the specific case\n",
      "of the prosecution that the injury to Harkesh on the thumb of his left hand\n",
      "was caused by a knife blow given by Rambir while he was trying to save Dinesh\n",
      "and Harkesh in his deposition before the court also attributed that injury to\n",
      "Rambir. Rambir, however, was held by the trial court to be not present at the\n",
      "place of occurrence. But the injury on the hand of Harkesh was certainly in\n",
      "existence and it was also proved by the medical evidence. The trial court\n",
      "resolved the contradiction by fastening the injury to Harkesh too on to the\n",
      "appellant Hari Kishan even though that was not the case of the prosecution.\n",
      "The appellant Hari Kishan was, thus, held guilty also of causing the knife\n",
      "injury to Harkesh and came to be convicted under section 324 in addition to\n",
      "section 302 of the Penal Code. Under section 324 he was sentenced to rigorous\n",

      "acquittal of the other three accused from the main charge of murder. Along\n",
      "with the three appeals the complainant also filed a revision (Criminal\n",
      "Revision No. 486 of 1998) agitating similar grievances as in the State's\n",
      "appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "14\\. The High Court by the judgment and order coming under appeal dismissed\n",
      "all the three appeals and the revision and, thus, upheld the judgments of the\n",
      "trial court in all aspects.\n",
      "\n",
      "15\\. Mr. J. L. Gupta, Senior Advocate, appearing for the appellant assailed\n",
      "the High Court and the trial court judgments and contended that the\n",
      "appellant's conviction for the offence of murder was not sustainable both in\n",
      "law and on 9 facts. Mr. Gupta submitted that there were at least four\n",
      "circumstances that falsified and completely demolished the prosecution case.\n",
      "First, there was a patent contradiction between the prosecution case and the\n",
      "motive assigned by it to the accused for committing the crime. Secondly, it\n",
      "was undeniable that injuries were fabricated both on the person of the\n",
      "deceased and Harkesh, the only eye witness whose evidence was accepted by the\n",
      "High Court and trial court. Thirdly, the prosecution had indisputably tried to\n",
      "falsely implicate three out of seven accused. Fourthly, the medical evidence\n",
      "completely belied the alleged time and the manner of occurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "16\\. Elaborating the points Mr. Gupta submitted that according to the\n",
      "prosecution the main cause of conflict between the two sides was the election\n",
      "of Suresh Kumar as the village Sarpanch who did not pay any heed to the\n",
      "demands of the accused. If that were so, the accused should have targeted\n",
      "Suresh Kumar and not Dinesh. Suresh Kumar was admittedly present at the time\n",
      "of the occurrence. He was unarmed and was also physically disabled, yet no\n",
      "attempt was made to assault him and he got away without a scratch and in his\n",
      "place Dinesh was killed against whom the accused had no animus.\n",
      "\n",
      "17\\. Mr. Gupta further submitted that even according to the prosecution case\n",
      "it was a chance encounter. The accused persons had no means to know that\n",
      "Dinesh would be coming from his baithak to his house to pick up his clothes\n",
      "and would be 10 passing through that particular spot at that particular time,\n",
      "so as to ambush him there, differently armed with gun, knife and lathis.\n",
      "\n",
      "18\\. Mr. Gupta next submitted that according to the prosecution case Dinesh\n",
      "was first struck on his back by lathis causing him to fall down on the ground.\n",
      "But in the post-mortem examination, no mark of injury of any kind was found on\n",
      "the back of the deceased. The post-mortem report further showed that three\n",
      "incised wounds (Injuries 2, 3, and 4) were inflicted on his body after he was\n",
      "dead. Obviously, those three injuries could not be attributed to any of the\n",
      "accused.\n",
      "\n",
      "In other words, the complainant had fabricated the injuries on the dead body\n",
      "of Dinesh with intent to make out a false case against the accused. Further,\n",
      "according to the post-mortem report, the time elapsed between death and post-\n",
      "mortem report was within eighteen hours. This, according to Mr. Gupta, clearly\n",
      "showed that death had taken place sometime the previous evening and not in the\n",
      "morning of June 24.\n",
      "\n",
      "19\\. Mr. Gupta further stated that the stab by knife (Injury No. 1) that\n",
      "caused the death of Dinesh had pierced through his heart and would have\n",
      "naturally led to profuse bleeding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shortly after receiving the injury the body of Dinesh was picked up from the\n",
      "ground by Harkesh (PW-2) and Bhim Singh (PW-4) to place him in the truck. And\n",
      "yet in reply to questions in the cross-examination Harkesh stated that his\n",
      "clothes or the clothes of Bhim Singh were not stained with 11 blood. No blood\n",
      "stained clothes of Harkesh or Bhim Singh were produced before the police.\n",
      "\n",
      "20\\. All these circumstances, according to Mr. Gupta, strongly indicated that\n",
      "the death of Dinesh did not take place in the manner and at the time as\n",
      "claimed by the prosecution.\n",
      "\n",
      "21\\. Mr. Gupta further submitted that the conviction of the appellant was\n",
      "based solely on the testimony of Harkesh whose presence at the time of\n",
      "occurrence was extremely doubtful. He once again referred to the medical\n",
      "evidence to support his submission that Harkesh had not received the injuries\n",
      "in the morning of June 24 when Dinesh was alleged to have been killed and\n",
      "hence, he could not have been present at the time of occurrence and he falsely\n",
      "claimed to be an eye witness of the occurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "22\\. On hearing Mr. Gupta and Mr. Alok Sangwan appearing for the State and on\n",
      "going through the judgments of the High Court and the trial court and the\n",
      "evidence on record we find that the submissions of Mr. Gupta are not entirely\n",
      "without substance and at least some of the points raised by him deserve\n",
      "serious consideration.\n",
      "\n",
      "23\\. It is seen above that the trial court doubted the presence of Bhim Singh\n",
      "(PW-4) & Suresh Kumar (PW-6) at the place of occurrence and did not accept\n",
      "their testimonies as eye witnesses. Even in regard to Harkesh (PW-2), the only\n",
      "eye witness remaining in the case, the trial court observed that he had mixed\n",
      "up falsehood with truth. Nevertheless, it did not 12 reject his testimony as a\n",
      "whole and accepted his evidence as regards the knife blow given to Dinesh by\n",
      "the appellant because \"he (PW-2) had some injuries in that incident as is\n",
      "clear from the statement of Dr. Krishan Kumar (PW-3)\" and hence, the presence\n",
      "of Harkesh (PW-2) at the place of occurrence could not be doubted. The High\n",
      "Court has also adopted the same approach and it has described Harkesh as an\n",
      "\"injured witness\". Mr. Gupta questioned the very premise that the injuries\n",
      "found on the person of Harkesh were caused in the same incident in which\n",
      "Dinesh was killed and which, according to the prosecution case, had taken\n",
      "place in the morning of June 24 and submitted that the trial court and the\n",
      "High Court had completely misread the medical evidence.\n",
      "\n",
      "24\\. According to the prosecution, the occurrence in which Dinesh was killed\n",
      "took place shortly after 6.15 in the morning of June 24. Harkesh was medically\n",
      "examined at 7.10 and Kanti Prakash at 7.15 am respectively, that is to say,\n",
      "within an hour when the wounds/injuries on their person would be very fresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "25\\. But the injury report of Harkesh disclosed as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"1) An incised wound on left hand between the thumb and index finger. 0.3 cm x\n",
      "0.2 cm skin deep clotted blood was present on the wound.\n",
      "\n",
      "2) Four contusions Parallel to each other present on the left shoulder and\n",
      "upper part of chest, horizontally placed reaching on the upper arm\n",
      "anteriorally in the area 8\"x4\" red in colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "3) A contusion on right upper arm on the meddle 1\"x05\" cm red in colour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Injury No. 1 was caused by sharp edged weapon and 13 injury No(s). 2 and 3\n",
      "were caused by blunt weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nature of injuries were simple, duration was 12 hours\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The injury report of Kanti Prakash noted as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"1) An abrasion and contusion on the parietal region of scalp in the vertex in\n",
      "the mid lone 11/2 x1cm blood was oozing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The injury was simple, caused by blunt weapon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The probable duration was 12 hours\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Further PW-3, the doctor who examined Harkesh and Kanti Prakash, in cross-\n",
      "examination, deposed before the court as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It is correct that the injuries on both these injured have been caused\n",
      "probably on 23/6/95 between 6 PM and 8 PM.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "26\\. Thus, according to the medical evidence, injuries on Harkesh were caused\n",
      "on the evening previous to the morning of June 24, when Dinesh was killed in\n",
      "the alleged occurrence.\n",
      "\n",
      "This takes away the basis on which he was accepted by the trial court and the\n",
      "High Court as an eye witness notwithstanding his proclivity to mix up\n",
      "falsehood with truth.\n",
      "\n",
      "27\\. The submission that Harkesh had received the injuries on the evening of\n",
      "June 23 and not in the morning of June, 24 gains credence from the fact that\n",
      "an incident between the two sides had admittedly taken place on the evening of\n",
      "June 23, 1995\\.\n",
      "\n",
      "28\\. In regard to the incident on the evening of June 23, 1995, Harkesh (PW-2)\n",
      "stated as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"On 23.6.95 there was an altercation between the accused and us and it was\n",
      "compromised with the 14 interventions of the respectable of the village.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As regards the incident on the evening of June 23, Harkesh further stated in\n",
      "his cross-examination that:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Bhim PW was not present at the time of earlier altercation on the previous\n",
      "day i.e. 23.6.95. That altercation lasted for 2 minutes. About 50/60 persons\n",
      "had collected including ladies had collected at that time. There are 4/5\n",
      "houses near the Chaupal where this altercation took place.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "29\\. In the face of the medical evidence and the admitted position that an\n",
      "incident between the two sides had taken place on the evening of June 23, 1995\n",
      "it is difficult to accept that the injuries found on the person of Harkesh\n",
      "were received by him in the morning of June 24. From this, either of two\n",
      "inferences would logically follow. One, Harkesh was not present at the\n",
      "occurrence in which Dinesh was killed in the morning of June 24; or the other,\n",
      "the occurrence in which Dinesh was killed did not take place in the morning of\n",
      "June 24 and he was not killed in the manner as suggested by the prosecution.\n",
      "Both the inferences are equally damaging to the prosecution case.\n",
      "\n",
      "30\\. Summing up the discussions made up, we have before us a case where a\n",
      "substantial part of the prosecution story has been disbelieved and the\n",
      "conviction of the appellant rests solely on the testimony of Harkesh (PW-2)\n",
      "who does not seem to have particular respect for truth as observed by the\n",
      "trial court. His credibility as an eye witness lay only in that the trial\n",
      "court and the High Court assumed that he had received 15 injuries in the same\n",
      "occurrence in which Dinesh was killed. As shown above that assumption does not\n",
      "appear to be very sound and is not borne out by the evidences on record. In\n",
      "such a situation, we find it highly unsafe to uphold and sustain the\n",
      "appellant's conviction for the offence of murder. To us, it appears that the\n",
      "prudent and safe course would be to give him the benefit of doubt.\n",
      "\n",
      "31\\. We, accordingly, allow the Criminal Appeal No. 133/09 and set aside the\n",
      "judgments of the High Court and the trial court and acquit him of the charges\n",
      "under sections 302 & 324\\.\n",
      "\n",
      "Criminal Appeal No. 134/09 relating to his conviction under section 25 of the\n",
      "Arms Act was not pressed, presumably because the conviction no longer carries\n",
      "any sentence. This is, accordingly, dismissed.\n",
      "\n",
      "32\\. The appellant Hari Kishan is directed to be released forthwith if he is\n",
      "not wanted in any other case.\n",

      "interest @ 18% per annum was calculated. These two amounts with which we are\n",
      "concerned, namely, the rentals of the cylinders and the notional interest\n",

      "\n",
      "Whether these two amounts were includible in the value under Section 4 of the\n",

      "hence, should be included in computing the assessable- value. The respondent,\n",
      "however, disputed that. They had neither included such rentals nor the\n",

      "Therefore, the revenue issued show-cause notices to the respondent. In their\n",
      "reply the respondent stated that the deposits from buyers were only to ensure\n",

      "\n",
      "The Asstt. Collector Central Excise, Visakhapatnam, by an order dated 3.6.1965\n",
      "held that the respondent had to pay excise-duty on the interest earned @ 18%\n",
      "during the relevant period. He further held that since the respondent had\n",
      "suppressed this fact from the revenue, in the past 5 years, under Rule 8 read\n",
      "with Section 11A of the Act, these are includible. He also included the\n",
      "rentals of these cylinders in the value. On an appeal, the Collector of\n",
      "Central Excise, Madras, upheld the said order with certain modifications.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dissatisfied with the aforesaid, the respondents appealed to the CEGAT. In its\n",

      "\"As regards charge on account of rental for the cylinders and the interest\n",
      "which accrues on account of deposit receipts for the supply of gases in\n",

      "related to the cost of manufacture of the goods as such.\" The Tribunal,\n",
      "therefore, under Section 4 deleted from the value, rentals for the cylinders\n",
      "and interest which accrued on account of deposit receipts for the supply of\n",
      "gases. Hence, this appeal by the Collector.\n",

      "comprehensive policy it covered all the statutory liabilities and the\n",
      "additional premium of Rs.300/- was paid for covering liability higher than the\n",
      "statutory liability in respect of passengers. The insurance policy, relevant\n",
      "part of which has been set out above, shows that it covered the following\n",
      "risks: (1) comprehensive risk, (2) S&R risk, (3) passenger risk and (4) legal\n",
      "liability in respect of paid driver, cleaner and conductor under Workmen's\n",
      "compensation Act. For the comprehensive risk the appellant had paid Rs.626/-\n",
      "as basic premium. Ordinarily the insurance policy does not cover strike and\n",
      "riot risk and, therefore, to cover that risk also the insured had paid\n",
      "additional premium of Rs.100/-. To cover 50 passengers' risk the insured had\n",
      "paid Rs.721.20 as additional premium. If the comprehensive risk covered all\n",
      "other risks as contended by the appellant then the policy would not have\n",
      "mentioned separately the S&K risk and passenger risk. Not only that they have\n",
      "been separately mentioned but separate amounts were paid by way of premium for\n",

      "3.Shri K. Madhava Reddy and Shri Gururaja Rao, learned Senior Counsel for the\n",
      "appellants contended that as the Act was made under Entry 35 of List III of\n",
      "the VIIth Schedule to the Constitution read with Article 246 of the\n",
      "Constitution, the Act receives paramountly and the Central Government alone is\n",

      "Mechanical Engineering becomes void since it runs in conflict with the\n",
      "qualifications prescribed by the Central Government. Therefore, the State\n",
      "rules become inapplicable. In support thereof, it was further contended that\n",
      "other State Governments had fallen in line in prescribing the qualification of\n",
      "Diploma in Mechanical Engineering prescribed by the Central Government and the\n",
      "State Government of A.P. had not adopted that course. Since the State rule is\n",
      "in conflict with the Central rule, the Central rule would prevail over the\n",
      "State rules, by operation of Article 254 of the Constitution.\n",

      "Government to appoint an officer or class of officers to implement the Act,\n",
      "sub- section (4) gives power to the Central Government to prescribe \"the\n",

      "5.Having given our anxious consideration to the respective contentions, we\n",
      "find that the State's contention merits acceptance. It is seen that marginal\n",
      "note in Section 213 for \"appointment of Motor Vehicles Officers\" indicates the\n",
      "subject-matter of the section. Sub-section (1) says that the State Government\n",
      "may, for the purpose of carrying into effect the provisions of this Act,\n",
      "establish Motor Vehicles Department and \"appoint as officers thereof such\n",
      "persons as it thinks fit\". The power of appointment includes the power to\n",
      "select a fit and competent person who it thinks fit to hold the post and would\n",
      "discharge efficiently the functions assigned under the Act. It includes the\n",
      "power to prescribe qualifications to select suitable officers. The Parliament\n",
      "preserved that power to the State Government under Section 213(1) itself by\n",
      "allowing it to appoint the officers whom it finds fit to carry into effect the\n",
      "provisions of the Act. Sub-section (4) gives power to the Central Government,\n",

      "services of the officers to be appointed under sub-section (1) of Section 213\n",
      "of the Act.\n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt, as contended by the learned counsel for the appellants that the Act\n",
      "receives paramountcy, since under Entry 35, the subject under the Act covers\n",
      "the concurrent field. Sub-section (4) of Section 213 also preserves the power\n",
      "to prescribe qualifications higher than that\"minimum qualification\" prescribed\n",

      "also to legislate on a matter enumerated in State List for any part of the\n",

      "the State Government and the Central Government in working the provisions of\n",
      "the Act. It is the State Government that operates the provisions of the Act\n",

      "the State Government to create Transport Department and to appoint officers,\n",

      "appointing its own officers, the State Government as a necessary adjunct is\n",
      "entitled to prescribe qualifications for recruitment or conditions of service.\n",
      "But while so prescribing, the State Government may accept the qualifications\n",
      "or prescribe higher qualification but in no case prescribe any qualification\n",
      "less than the qualifications prescribed by the Central Government under sub-\n",
