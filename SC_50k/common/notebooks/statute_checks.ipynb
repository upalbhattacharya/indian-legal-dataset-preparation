      "25.05.2011 Introduction 1. The prayer in this writ petition is for a direction to the Union of India, Ministry of Human Resource Development HRD to frame appropriate and objective standards towards the determination and levying of royalties of various copyrighted works administered by Phonographic Performance Limited PPL, Respondent no. 3, and the Indian Performing Right Society Limited IPRSL, Respondent no. 4, or any other society that may be so created by it, and the mode of enforcing and administering such royalties when so fixed. A further direction is for investigation of the books of account of PPL and IPRSL to ascertain whether they have paid their dues to the owners authors of copyrights. Case of the Petitioner 2. The Petitioner, Event and Entertainment Management Association EEMA, is a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860 1908 , 1860. It comprises of members from all over India who are engaged in the business of organizing events, functions and entertainment shows like road shows, music concerts shows, brand promotion, dealers meet and other social events like marriages and get togethers etc. Individual members of EEMA are stated to provide their services for organization of events and entertainment wherein they themselves are neither hosts nor guests but act merely as service providers. It is stated that during the aforesaid events and shows, the members of EEMA, as per the instructions of their clients, host or arrange or make arrangements for playing music recorded on tapes, compact discs, DVDs and other storage devices legally available in the markets. They also arrange for performance of live music, instrumental as well as singing of literary works in the form of songs by known as well as not so known artists performers. It is further stated that in all three categories of events, i.e. social functions, brand promotion events and purely commercial events, live or recorded music is played or performed. 3. Respondent no. 1 has registered PPL and IPRSL as copyright societies in terms of [SECTION] CR Act. While PPL is registered as a copyright society for sound recordings, IPRSL is for musical and literary works. The exploitation of a sound recording implies exploitation of the underlying literary or musical work as well. One important function of the PPL and IPRSL is the business of granting licence in respect of the works wherein copyright exists and to charge royalties towards the same. Accordingly, the licence fee for the sound recordings on the one hand and the literary and musical works on the other have to be paid for separately by the users thereof to PPL and IPRSL respectively on behalf of their members who hold the relevant copyrights thereto. By a letter dated 15th October 1997, the HRD Ministry clarified that since the public performance of music involves mechanical rights in sound recording as well as rights of composers, performers etc. licences from both PPL and IPRSL have to be obtained for playing recorded music whose copyright administration vests in these two societies. EEMA contends that Respondent no.1 has failed to exercise its jurisdiction under [SECTION_UNK] CR Act to set down any objective standards and criteria for charging of royalties by PPL and IPRSL. It is stated that both the PPL and IPRSL are acting arbitrarily in fixing tariffs with no objective standards and have assumed the role of the W.P. C 5422 of 2008 legislature in fixing the amount of royalties at their sole discretion, the role of a law enforcer in enforcing the collection of such royalties and in taking coercive action against the members of EEMA. It is stated that demanding of royalties for playing music at social functions and events is a violation of [SECTION_UNK] CR Act. It is submitted that inasmuch as Respondent no. 1 has a constitutional obligation under [SECTION] not to act arbitrarily or unreasonably the same applies to copyright societies like PPL and IPRSL, constituted under [SECTION_UNK] CR Act. It is further submitted that the valuable rights of the members of EEMA to carry on their trade under [SECTION] cannot be violated by the PPL and IPRSL. Stand of Respondent no. 3 PPL 4. In its counter affidavit PPL contended that by the amendments brought about by the Copyright Amendment Act , 1994 Amendment Act 1994, the erstwhile provisions of Chapter VII of the CR Act relating to performing right societies were replaced. The new Chapter VII contains elaborate provisions regarding the conduct, self governance and accountability of the management of all copyright societies. The contention is that under the amended provisions copyright societies are made strictly accountable to their owners, do not enjoy any monopoly, and their licence fees are subject to market forces. It is submitted that the amended provisions of Chapter VII of the CR Act reflect the current legislative policy, encompassing economic policy. It is submitted that the writ jurisdiction cannot be invoked to intervene in such policy. It is further submitted that EEMA has not supplied any data which could justify its apprehension that the licence fees as determined by PPL are unreasonable. It is submitted that members of EEMA who are themselves organizers of events costing lakhs and crores of rupees cannot plead their inability to pay the modest licence fees charged by the copyright societies. It is pointed out that in relation to every kind of dispute regarding the subsistence of copyright or liability for infringement there are civil remedies provided under Chapter XII of the CR Act. In many cases many of the members of EEMA have been paying licence fees to PPL and other owners of copyright for their live events. It is submitted that the present petition has been filed only with a view to avoid payment of licence fees. It is further submitted that the Memorandum of Association of EEMA does not contain a clause whereby EEMA may sue or be sued. There is no authorization by the governing body of EEMA for filing the present petition. 5. Explaining the importance and utility of copyright societies, PPL states that the amended provisions of the CR Act in a sense acknowledge the difficulties of the members of the copyright societies in individually enforcing their copyrights. Individual members of copyright societies cannot also be expected to identify and chase broadcasting organizations, shops, ships, aircrafts, departmental stores, showrooms, emporiums, restaurants, hotels, clubs, offices, organizers of live concerts etc. all over the world where the copyrighted works may be used or commercially exploited. Copyright societies collect royalties after deduction of administrative expenses as prescribed under Rule 14H of the Copyright Rules, 1958 CR Rules which are distributed amongst the members of the copyright societies in proportion to the actual use of the works of such members subject to the scheme which are approved by the members. It is asserted that the fee structure fixed by PPL is collectively decided by the members of the PPL in an Annual General Meeting AGM. PPL is required to fix tariffs at a level which balances affordability of music to users and at the same time ensures fair returns. It is submitted that the fee structures fixed by PPL are reasonable and in fact work out only to a negligible and insignificant percentage of the turnover of, for example, shops, departmental stores, showrooms, emporiums, hotels, pubs and restaurants, or of the cost of high profile events such as those organized by the members of EEMA. 6. Copies of the Gazette Notification dated 18th May 2002 giving a complete list of the types of licence and the corresponding fees to be paid, as partially modified and published in the Gazette Notification dated 10th September 2005, have been enclosed with the counter affidavit of PPL. The licences issued by the PPL can broadly be classified into two separate categories annual licenses granted to various establishments for playing the sound recordings administered by PPL as piped music or background music etc. in their respective establishments annual licence and, individual licences granted to an establishment for playing sound records belonging to PPLs repertoire during an event show organized by the establishments on special occasions like New Years eve event licence. Most of the hotels have obtained both annual and event licences keeping in view the separate sets of rights flowing from the particular licences. It is stated that by paying an annual fee to PPL, an establishment obtains automatic and blanket permission to play music from the vast collection of millions of songs, both Indian and foreign. No time and cost is lost in either travelling or in entering into any other form of negotiations with the right holders. Further, uniform rates are charged, W.P. C 5422 of 2008 eliminating the difficulty that a user may face from some particular, unreasonable copyright owner. Further, the emphasis of the whole system is to provide a single window clearance through which a user gets quick, automatic permission without any cost of travel or negotiation for all works. A list of countries in which such systems are prevalent has been enclosed with PPLs counter affidavit. Stand of Respondent no. 4 IPRSL 7. Respondent no. 4, IPRSL, in its counter affidavit raises more or less the same preliminary objection as the PPL. It is stated that IPRSL is affiliated to 200 world societies of authors and composers, which are included within its Federation, i.e. CISAC, Paris established under the auspicious of UNESCO and WIndian Penal Code, 1860 harter. IPRSL is also a member of the Copyright Enforcement Advisory Council CEAC set up by the Government of India to advise the government regarding measures for improving the enforcement of the CR Act. The members of IPRSL comprising of authors, composers and publishers of Indian literary and musical works have executed deeds of assignment, assigning their public performing rights and communication to the public rights in respect of their literary and or musical works including such literary and musical works which they may own in the future, in favour of IPRSL. It is asserted that for IPRSL, this is the most efficacious way of enforcing the rights of its members as this allows IPRSL to act more efficiently. Since the membership is for a limited set of rights and subsists during the membership of IPRSL, the interests of individual members are also protected. The membership of the Board of the Governing Council of IPRSL, comprises lyricists, music composers, music publishers comprising of music companies film other audio visual producers. It is pointed out that the CR Act recognizes lyrics writers and music composers created works as literary and musical works and they belong to a number of categories like musical compositions and performances. The owner of the copyright in the literary or musical works enjoys a number of rights exclusively, which are set out in [SECTION_UNK] a of the CR Act. 8. The counter affidavit of IPRSL illustrates the advantages enjoyed by the Copyright Board or the members of IPRSL. It also illustrates the advantages to those like the Petitioner who obtained licences for use of such copyright work from IPRSL. It is stated that royalty rates fixed by IPRSL are relative to the value of the music to the establishment concerned. It is stated that the object, therefore, while fixing tariffs, is to W.P. C 5422 of 2008 ensure affordability and at the same time ensure just rewards to the creators of music. The counter affidavit of IPRSL refers to the CR Rules which provided for an exhaustive procedure for application and conditions for grant of permission to carry on the copyright business. It is further stated that the conditions set out under the CR Rules, 1958 are tailored to satisfy the registering authority of the collective nature of the applicant. 9. It is stated that working of the copyright societies continues to be monitored and guided by the CR Act. A copyright society is expected to submit a report of returns under Rule 14M CR Rules. Rule 14P CR Rules requires IPRSL to submit annual returns which would contain various details such as audited accounts of the society, tariff scheme, distribution scheme, and a declaration from the governing body of IPRSL as regards all its activities. It is submitted that the tariff fixed by IPRSL may be called into question before the CB under [SECTION_UNK] CR Act. Inasmuch as the tariff in the present case has been fixed by IPRSL diligently and after collective decision of the members of IPRSL taken in an AGM it cannot be said to be arbitrary, unreasonable or violative of any provision of any law. It is stated that there are adequate safeguards provided within the CR Act to check the consequences of any perceived excessive delegation inasmuch as [SECTION_UNK] 4 CR Act provides that the central government may, if it is satisfied that a copyright society is being managed in a manner detrimental to the interest of the owners of the copyrights, cancel the registration of such society after such inquiry, as may be prescribed. Under [SECTION_UNK] CR Act, the central government can also call for any report or any record of any copyright society for the purpose of satisfying itself that the fees collected by the society in respect of rights administered by it are being utilized or distributed in accordance with the provisions of the CR Act. Stand of Respondent no. 1 UOI 10. The counter affidavit filed by Respondent no. 1, UOI, on 14th July 2009, did not deal with the contention raised by the Petitioner that monopoly rights are being created in favour of societies without any regulatory mechanism to deal with arbitrary price fixation. Consequently, by an order dated 16th July 2009, this Court directed the UOI to file an additional affidavit. On 22nd October 2009 four weeks were further granted to file the said additional affidavit. After costs were imposed by an order dated 19th February 2010, the UOI filed the said additional affidavit on 30th April 2010. It is pointed W.P. C 5422 of 2008 out by the UOI that the disputes involving royalty licence fee are sub judice, at the instance of some of the members of EEMA before the Copyright Board CB. It is contended that since an efficacious remedy is available to EEMA before the CB, the present writ petition ought not to be entertained. The affidavit of UOI also sets out the chronology of the litigation and the record of evidence before the CB in the various petitions relating to fixation of royalty and licence fee for various copyright works in which some of the members of the Petitioner Association are involved. The list of writ petitions and the issues pending in this Court have also been set out. EEMAs stand in rejoinder 11. EEMA has, in response to the additional affidavit, filed a reply on 16th July 2010 pointing out that the said additional affidavit does not answer the contention of the Petitioners that the copyright societies have deliberately created a monopoly in the fixation of tariff and royalty and that they have acted in an arbitrary and unjust manner. It is pointed out that in its order dated 19th November 2002 in the case of Music Broadcast Private Limited v. Phonographic Performance Limited 2003 26 PTC 70 the CB has noticed that there are no reasonable standards or data available on the basis of which the CB can determine royalty rates and that they have to act only on the basis of a best judgment assessment which is open to the arbitrariness, uncertainty, modifications and alterations. EEMA has also filed copies of the tariff schedule of PPL, the extracts of the audited accounts IPRSL, a sampling of the agreements entered into between the owners of copyright and IPRSL 12. This Court has heard the submissions of Mr. S.K. Bansal, learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner, Mr. Sumeet Pushkarna, learned counsel for the UOI, Mr. Sudhir Chandra, learned Senior counsel and Mr. Jagdish Sagar learned counsel for PPL and Mr. Amit Dutta, learned counsel on behalf of IPRSL. The statutory scheme under the CR Act 13. The relevant provisions of the CR Act and CR Rules may be referred to first. [SECTION_UNK] CR Act prior to its amendment provided for a performing rights society PRS under Chapter VII. Under [SECTION_UNK] 1 of the unamended CR Act, every PRS was to furnish to the Registrar of Copyrights Registrar a statement of all fees, charges or royalties which it proposed to collect for the grant of licences for performance in public of works W.P. C 5422 of 2008 in respect of which it had authority to grant such licences. Failure to do so disentitled the PRS from initiating action in relation to performing that work except with the consent of the Registrar. Under [SECTION_UNK] of the unamended CR Act, any person having any objections to any fees, charges or royalties or other particulars included in any statement referred to in [SECTION_UNK] may at any time lodge such objections in writing at the Copyright Office. Both objections were to be decided under [SECTION_UNK] of the CR Act. The Amendment Act , 1994 introduces the concept of the copyright societies under [SECTION_UNK] of the CR Act, which as amended in 1994 reads as under 14. PPL and the IPRSL are both registered under [SECTION_UNK] 3 CR Act. Under [SECTION_UNK] 5 CR Act, the central government can, in the interests of the owners of copyrights, suspend the registration of a copyright society pending inquiry for such period not exceeding one year. Under [SECTION_UNK] 4 CR Act the central government can cancel the registration of a copyright society after inquiry if it is satisfied that the copyright society is being managed in a manner detrimental to the interests of the owners of rights concerned. Further, the administration of rights of owners by a copyright society is provided in [SECTION_UNK] of the CR Act, which reads as under 15. Further, under [SECTION_UNK]-A CR Act special rights can be conferred on a copyright W.P. C 5422 of 2008 society in respect of certain classes of works. [SECTION_UNK] A reads as under 16. The control over the copyright society by the owner of rights is specified under [SECTION_UNK] reads as under 17. There is an obligation of the copyright society to submit returns and reports under [SECTION_UNK] CR Act which reads as under 18. This has to be read along with Rule 14 MCR which reads as under 19. The above provisions make it clear that in their functioning the copyright societies are controlled by and are accountable to the owners of the copyrights. There is also an overall supervisory control by the central government. As regards the power to fix tariffs, the earlier scheme under the unamended CR Act has been consciously departed from by the legislature. There are checks put in place in terms of [SECTION_UNK] 3 at the time of registration of a copyright society. The central government has to account for the interests of authors and other owners of rights as well as the interests and convenience of the public and in particular of the groups of persons who are most likely to seek licences. Once a copyright society is registered, the control that can be exercised over it by the central government and by the owners of the copyrights is as given in [SECTION_UNK] CR Act. Instead of the central government itself controlling the fixation of royalty tariff, the legislature has required the copyright society to fix tariffs subject to obtaining approval of the owners of rights. This is as regards the procedure of collection and distribution of fees as well as for the utilization of any amounts collected as fees for any purpose other than distribution to the owner of rights. The copyright society will provide to such owners regular, full and detailed information concerning all its activities in relation to the administration of their rights. The above statutory provisions have been supplemented by Rules 12, 14, 14A, 14B, 14F, 14G, 14H, 14I, 14J and 14K CR Rules. In addition Rule 14L CR Rules provides for meeting of copyright societies, 14M provides for accounts and proper audit. Under Rule 14L, as soon as the Tariff Scheme and the Distribution Scheme are prepared, the copyright society is to call a general meeting of the owners of rights whose names are recorded in the Register of Owners to approve the same. Under Rule 14N, within a period of twelve months from the holding of a meeting, an AGM is to be held of the owners of rights. The documents to be presented in the annual general W.P. C 5422 of 2008 meeting of owners of rights are listed out under Rule 14O. Under Rule 14P, returns are to be filed by the copyright societies with the Registrar of Copyrights. In other words, under Chapter V of the CR Rules, a very detailed procedure has been laid out to regulate the working of copyright societies. This has to be further understood in the context of [SECTION_UNK] CR Act which provides for assignment of copyright. Such assignment is a pre condition to becoming a member of IPRSL or any other copyright society. As a result of such assignment the copyright society becomes the exclusive owner of the public performing rights of its members. Under [SECTION_UNK] a CR Act, the bundle of rights constituting the rights in a literary, dramatic or musical work, not being a computer programme has been set out. [SECTION_UNK] c CR Act specifies the rights in an artistic work and [SECTION_UNK] e the rights in a sound recording. Performing rights would include the right to perform the work, the right to communicate the work to the public by making any cinematograph film or sound recording in respect of the work. [SECTION_UNK] c which defines artistic work, [SECTION_UNK] d which defines author, [SECTION_UNK] ffa which defines composer, [SECTION_UNK] qq which defines performer and [SECTION_UNK] uu which defines producer, acknowledge the entire range of persons who may have rights in a musical work, an artistic work, a literary work or a performance, each of which have also been defined. 20. The entire bundle of rights which are acknowledged and protected in terms of [SECTION_UNK] a of the CR Act which also sets out the meaning of copyright. That there is extensive use of musical and artistic works and sound recordings by event organizers is acknowledged by the Amendment Act 1994. The interests of both the copyright owners and the users have been sufficiently addressed in these amendments. Copyright societies were given the powers to fix the tariff but only with the approval of the owners of copyrights who are its members. Learned counsel for PPL and IPRSL have rightly pointed out that their clients not only serve the interests of their members but the community of users as well. Once the users of work obtain a licence from the copyright societies in respect of a copyrighted work, their user of such work becomes legal. The payment of the tariff as demanded by the copyright societies ensures that they will have no individual dispute between the user of the copyright and the owner of the copyright or members of the copyright societies. Functioning of copyright societies in other jurisdictions 21. The system of having copyright societies to fix and administer royalties and tariffs in copyright work is not unique to India. There are Collective Management Organizations CMOs that have been prevalent in France since the 1970s. The government there has, therefore, introduced a system of extensive monitoring and control of such CMOs. A Committee constituted is empowered to access all documents, data and software used by a CMO and also to question the CMOs auditors, wherein confidentiality obligation of such auditor would be suspended. Moreover, members are given the right to obtain specific information from their CMO. The Administration of Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act, 1963 in Germany mandates publication or tariffs. It requires that in establishing tariffs and in collecting the remuneration, collecting societies shall have due regard to religion, cultural and social interests of the persons liable to pay the remuneration. In the United Kingdom, the copyright collecting societies have emerged as a prominent private mechanism to monitor infringement and for management of copyrights. The tariff is fixed by negotiating with the association of users. There is no role assigned to the Copyright Tribunal in the U.K. to regulate the relationship between the societies and users. In the United States there are performing rights societies which are entrusted with the task of enforcing copyrights on behalf of the owners of the copyright. For the purposes of compulsory licensing, copyright offices can establish Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels to determine reasonable terms and rates of royalty payments. The European Community Law lays down certain principles for the functioning of the cooperative societies 22. What is relevant is that each country has its system of state regulation of the functioning of copyright and performing rights societies. The practice and legislative policy of one country cannot ipso facto be adopted in another. What is reasonable and W.P. C 5422 of 2008 permissible within the legal and constitutional framework has to be examined with reference to the position in our country. As far as India is concerned the CR Act and CR Rules provide for a complete scheme. Given that the constitutional validity of the relevant provisions concerning copyright societies has been upheld, those provisions have to be given full effect to. 23. Mr. Bansal relied upon the passages from Intellectual Property Law by Lionel Bently and Brad Sherman, Oxford 2001, in which it is stated that having a single body solely responsible for administering rights of copyright owners posed problems for both members and users. It is stated that problems with members typically occur because a copyright owner has little alternative to joining the society, which can thus impose restrictive terms. The authors point out that a second set of problems arises from the relations with users, who similarly have little alternative but to take a licence from the collecting society on whatever terms it chooses. Due to these problems, collecting societies have been described in terms similar to the atom bomb as at once the most ingenious and the worst invention of mankind. While the above problems might still occur as far as the PPL and IPRSL are concerned, Sections 33 4 and 33 5 and [SECTION_UNK] read with [SECTION_UNK] CR Act provide adequate safeguards. It is not as if the copyright societies under the CR Act have a free run as regards the fixation of tariffs and royalties in copyright works. Tariffs fixed by PPL and IRPSL not an arbitrary exercise of power 24. The contention on behalf of EEMA that by delegating all the powers in relation to fixation of tariffs to the copyright societies, the central government has abdicated its essential function under the CR Act, overlooks the fact that the legislature has made a conscious shift from the statutory scheme whereby central government retained a regulatory power over the fixation of tariffs. This petition is not concerned with the validity of the amended provisions. A Division Bench of this Court has, in a judgment recently passed on 7th April 2011 in W.P. C no. 452 of 1999 The Federation of Hotels Restaurants Association of India v. Union of India upheld the constitutional validity of Sections 33 3 and 34 3 of the CR Act as amended read with [SECTION_UNK] xx and [SECTION_UNK] thereof. This Court negatived the prayer made in that petition by the users of copyrighted works for a direction against PPL for charging fees for special events licence and the rates notified by PPL for the year 2005 for the special events. This Court W.P. C 5422 of 2008 upheld the preliminary objection raised by the IPRSL and the PPL that the Petitioners in that case ought to have approached the Registrar if they had a grievance about the quantum of charges demanded by PPL and IPRSL for grant of compulsory licence in respect of copyrighted works. It was further observed by this Court that the user should first take up the grievance with the government and persuade it to exercise the powers under [SECTION_UNK] CR Act if the user was aggrieved by the manner of functioning of the copyright societies. Answering in the negative the specific question that are any of the provisions of the Copyright Act, 1957 or the Copyright Rules 1958 framed thereunder ultra vires the constitution, this Court relied upon the judgment in Indian Performing Right Society v. Eastern Indian Motion Pictures Association 1977 2 SCC 820 as well as the observations in Entertainment Network India Limited v. Super Cassette Industries Limited 2008 13 SCC 30. In para 16 of the judgment the Division Bench of this Court observed as under 25. Bound as it is by the judgment of the Division Bench, which in turn relied upon the judgments of the Supreme Court, this Court declines to further examine the issue of unreasonableness of the tariffs fixed by PPL or IPRSL or the scope of their powers in that regard under [SECTION_UNK] CR Act read with the CR Rules. Mr. Bansal referred to the tariff schedule of the PPL and certain extracts of the statement of accounts of the IPRSL to urge that the money collected by them as royalties was not being defrayed for appropriate purposes. The question whether the copyright societies have discharged their functions in accordance with the CR Act must be examined in the first instance by the central government in which adequate powers have been vested under [SECTION_UNK] 4 read with [SECTION_UNK] 3 CR Act. The owners of the copyright too have adequate supervisory control over the functioning of the copyright societies of which they are members. Nothing has been shown to indicate that the procedure outlined by the CR Rules has not been followed by the copyright societies in the fixation of tariffs. What should be the appropriate tariff for a copyrighted work, how the royalties and fees collected should be distributed amongst the owners of different rights are issues which are required to be left to be determined by the copyright societies working under the control of the copyright owners. In any event, this Court is not equipped to entertain a disputed question of fact in relation to the fixation of tariffs in a writ petition under [SECTION]. This Court is therefore not persuaded to hold that the PPL or IPRSL have acted arbitrarily or unreasonably in fixing tariffs for copyrighted works. Not a case of excessive delegation of legislative powers 26. It was then urged by Mr. Bansal that under [SECTION_UNK] 2 c, ce, cf, d da and db, it is for the central government to make rules and not for the copyright societies to take over from the central government the functions of collection and distribution of fees, approval for utilization of any amount collected as fees, the manner of payment of royalties and maintenance of accounts. Mr. Bansal relied upon the judgments concerning excessive delegation including Hamdard Dawakhana v. Union of India AIR 1960 SC 554, Dai lchi Karkaria Limited v. Unon of India 2000 SCC 57, Mansukh Lal Chauhan v. State of Gujarat AIR 1997 SC 3400 and Chandrakant Muljibhai Parikh v. State of Gujarat AIR 2001 Gujarat 234. He sought to make a distinction between conditional legislation and delegated legislation and urged that tariff fixation itself was a legislative activity which was delegated to the central government by the Parliament and W.P. C 5422 of 2008 which could not have been further delegated to the copyright societies. 27. This Court is unable to agree with the above submission of Mr. Bansal. Rules have been framed by the central government under [SECTION_UNK] CR Act. Chapter V of the CR Rules concerns copyright societies. The rules thereunder are relatable to [SECTION_UNK] 2 c, ca and 78 2 d, da and db CR Act. The central government has laid down the procedure to be followed by copyright societies in obtaining approval of the owners of rights for collection and distribution of fees. It details the procedure for copyright societies to draw up the Tariff Scheme and the Distribution Scheme which are defined under Rule 14J and 14K of the CR Rules respectively. Rules 14J and 14K read as under 28. A detailed procedure has been laid down for holding meetings of the copyright societies, including the AGM, for approval of the Tariff Scheme and the Distribution Scheme. This is followed by filing of the returns with the Registrar of Copyrights. Given the scope of [SECTION_UNK] 3 the legislative intent is to give the copyright societies the power to fix the tariff but in consultation with the approval of the owners of copyrights. The role of the government under the CR Act is that of oversight of the functioning of the copyright societies under [SECTION_UNK] 3, 4 and 5 CR Act. [SECTION_UNK] 2 authorizes the central government to call for any report and also call for any records of the copyright society. The central governments power of rule making under [SECTION_UNK] 2 is only with regard to the conditions subject to which a copyright society may issue licences, collect fees and distribute such fees amongst owners of rights [SECTION_UNK] 2 ce, manner of determining any royalties payable [SECTION_UNK] 2 d, the manner of payment of W.P. C 5422 of 2008 royalty [SECTION_UNK] 2 da and obtaining approval of owners of copyright to utilization of the fees collected and distributed [SECTION_UNK] 2 cf. The relevant CR Rules referred to hereinbefore adequately deal with each of the above areas. There is no ambiguity. It is not as if there is no legislative guidance or norms that can be discerned from these provisions. They constitute sufficient safeguards to ensure that the exercise of these powers by the copyright societies is not arbitrary or unreasonable. This Court is, therefore, unable to agree with the learned counsel for the Petitioner that this is a case of excessive delegation of legislative powers by the central government to the copyright societies. 29. In Entertainment Network India Limited, the Supreme Court discussed the provisions of the CR Act in detail. It has spelt out the scope of the powers of the copyright societies. It pointed out that the CR Act itself maintained a balance between the interests of the owner of copyright in protecting his work on the one hand and the interest of the public in having access to such work on the other. This Court is not persuaded to hold that the fixation of tariff or royalties by PPL and IPRSL in exercise of their powers under the CR Act is per se arbitrary or unreasonable. 30. Having said that, it must be emphasized that any challenge to an instance of tariff fixation by PPL or IPRSL can be raised before the CB. In fact, this has already been done. The case sent on remand to the Copyright Board following the judgment of the Supreme Court in Entertainment Network India Limited has already been adjudicated by the CB. It is not, therefore, as if there is no remedy available to the user of the copyright who is aggrieved by the fixation of tariff by a copyright society. Conclusion 31. For all the aforesaid reasons, this Court is not inclined to grant any of the reliefs as prayed for. The writ petition is dismissed with no order as to costs. The pending application is disposed of.

      "ANU MALHOTRA, J. 1. The appellant namely Rinku Ram Prasad, vide the present appeal assails the impugned judgment dated 22.03.2019 and the impugned order on sentence dated 23.03.2019 of the learned ASJ-01, North West, Rohini, Delhi Special Court POCSO in Sessions Case no.44/2017 vide which the appellant herein was convicted for the offence punishable under [SECTION] and [SECTION_UNK] of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 hereinafter referred to as POCSO Act, 2012 and was sentenced to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for a period of seven years along Crl.A.865/2019 with a fine of rs.5,000/- and in default of the payment of fine, to further undergo Simple Imprisonment for a period of three years for the offence punishable under [SECTION] and was sentenced to undergo Rigorous Imprisonment for a period of 10 years along with a fine of rs.10,000/- and in default of the payment of fine, to further undergo Simple Imprisonment for a period of six months for the offence punishable under [SECTION_UNK] of the POCSO Act, 2012, with it having been directed that both the sentences would run concurrently. 2. The Trial Court Record was requisitioned, has been received and has been perused. 3. The nominal roll received from the Superintendent Jail-04, Tihar, Delhi indicates that on the date 19.08.2019, the appellant herein had undergone a period of 2 years 9 months and 21 days of incarceration with a period of 24 days of remission with the unexpired portion of the sentence being 7 years 1 month and 15 days in the event of having remaining unpaid, which in the instant case has apparently not been paid. The jail conduct of the appellant has been reported to be satisfactory. 4. The appellant in the instant case as indicated vide the impugned judgment of the learned Trial Court has been identified by the victim C aged 5 years as being the person who had on 23.10.2016 forcibly taken her towards the bushes and then he inserted his peshab wali jagah in her peshab wali jagah and on her screaming, he had run away and the minor child victim C also identified the appellant as being the person known as Janu ka chacha Rinku who had lifted her Crl.A.865/2019 and taken her towards the bushes, where he had removed his under wear and the minor childs under wear and then inserted his penis into her vagina and she thus, screamed out of pain and then that boy had run away. The factum of the commission of the aggravated penetrative sexual assault in terms of [SECTION_UNK] of the POCSO Act, 2012 having been inflicted on the victim C, has not been disputed by the appellant and the same is also clearly brought forth through the MLC of the minor victim C dated 23.10.2016 which shows the hymen torn the orifice being 0.25x0.25 cm, though the child was not allowing proper examination. 5. The mother Smt. P of the victim C examined as PW-4 had stated in her testimony on oath before the learned Trial Court that on 23.10.2016 at about 7.00 PM, she was cooking food and the victim C was watching television in the house sitting beside her and after a few minutes, the child had gone to play with the children in the gali and after some time a girl named N came to her i.e. Smt. P and informed that something had happened to the minor child victim C and she was bleeding from her thighs, then the mother Smt. P of the minor child victim C rushed immediately with N and reached at the corner of the gali where she found her daughter i.e. C standing and she was bleeding from her thighs and thus, she i.e. Smt. P took her back to the house and checked her internal parts of the body after removing her underwear and she found that the blood was oozing from her private part and on inquiry, the minor child victim C told her mother Smt. P that one boy who lives in the area took her in the jungle and committed wrong act and later on, the minor child victim C told the Crl.A.865/2019 name of that person was Jaanu ka Chacha, i.e. Rinku and further informed her mother Smt. P that the accused i.e. the appellant herein had put his private part into her private part usne apne shu shu mere shu shu main daal diya and when she cried, the accused had run away from there after leaving the child in the jungle. 6. The prosecutrix victim i.e. the minor child i.e. C examined as PW-3 before the learned Trial Court aged 6 years at the time when her testimony was recorded on 13.12.2017 was examined by the learned Trial Court to ascertain whether she was capable of understanding the questions and gave rational answers and on being satisfied that the minor child was capable of giving rational answers put to her, the minor child i.e. C was examined by the learned Trial Court without administering her oath in view of her tender age, in which she stated to the effect- 7. The minor child through her testimony was categorical to the effect that the person who committed rape on her was the accused. On behalf of the appellant, it was contended that it was a case of mistaken identity, in as much as the child in the first statement given to her mother had told her that a tall boy who lived in the same area where they lived had forcibly picked her up in his arms and had taken her into the bushes in front of the lane and had committed a wrong act with her and had first taken of his under wear and the minor childs underwear and then inserted his penis into her vagina and thus she had started shouting, then he left her and ran away and it was thus submitted on behalf of the appellant that even though, the minor child victim stated that the person lived in the area where the minor child Crl.A.865/2019 victim lived, the name of the appellant was not given by the child nor was it mentioned in the FIR and rather through the FIR, the complainant i.e. P, the mother of the minor child victim had stated that some unknown boy had committed rape on her child. 8. In relation to this aspect, it is essential to observe that through her statement recorded under [SECTION] . on 24.10.2016, the mother of the victim i.e. C had clearly given the name of the appellant as being the person who had taken away her child into the bushes and raped her, in as much as she stated that she had taken her child i.e. the victim C to the Jag Jeevan Hospital and she was medically examined and there a girl named Z asked some questions to her daughter i.e. to the minor child victim C who had named the accused i.e. the appellant herein Rinku who also named as Jaanu Ka Chacha who had picked her up and had taken her and had committed a wrong act with her through the susuwala Raasta. 9. The minor child victim C through her statement under [SECTION] . dated 27.10.2016 had also categorically stated to the effect that she was burning some fire and taking some heat and then Jaanu ka chacha came, whose name was Rinku and picked her up in his arms, took her to the jungle and then caused her pain in her vagina and blood came out and took off her underwear and also his underwear and again caused her pain and the child pointed towards her vagina and also stated that the accused i.e. the appellant put his finger into the same and then also put his penis into her vagina. 10. The minor child examined as PW-3 whose testimony has also been adverted to hereinabove, categorically identified the accused Crl.A.865/2019 person in the Court from the wooden partition as being the person who had committed the aggravated penetrative sexual assault on her and the minor child victim has also categorically stated even through her statement made in the Court on 13.12.2017 that the person who had picked her up and took her away and had committed the offence of penetrative assault on her was the person known as Jaanu Ka Chacha. As is well settled the statement of the minor child would suffice when held trustworthy which it is so held in the facts and circumstances of the instant case to incriminate and bring forth the charge of allegations that was framed against the appellant on 29.04.2017 of the commission of the offences punishable under [SECTION] and [SECTION_UNK]m of the POCSO Act punishable under [SECTION_UNK] of the POCSO Act, 2012. 11. Through his statement under [SECTION] , the accused i.e. the appellant herein has not refuted that he is the Jaanu Ka Chacha and only claims that he has been falsely implicated in the matter, in as much as there were no talking terms between his family and the victims family. The accused had also stated through his statement under [SECTION] that the victim had been tutored and had earlier stated that the person who had committed the offence upon her was ek lamba ladka i.e. a tall boy and that he himself was a short heighted person. During the course of the submissions that were made on behalf of the accused i.e. the appellant herein, it was submitted that the appellant was 5 feet in height. Taking into account the factum that the prosecutrix is a minor who was of 5 years of age at the time of the commission of the offence, the height of Crl.A.865/2019 5 feet certainly falls within the ambit of a person being tall for a minor child. 12. The circumstances of the instant case thus, do not in any manner bring forth that the identity of the appellant is in any manner in dispute and taking into account the factum that the child through her first statement under [SECTION] had stated that the person who committed the aggravated penetrative sexual assault on her was Jaanu ka Chacha, taking into account the factum that the prosecutrix identified the accused i.e. the appellant before the Trial Court as being that person who committed the said offence on her and taking into account the factum that the prosecutrix through her testimony coupled with the factum that the prosecutrix through her statement before the Court stated that the person who committed the offence on her was that Jaanu ka Chacha, it becomes apparent that the identity of the appellant as being the sole perpetrator of the crime committed on the minor child, has been established beyond a reasonable doubt and to the hilt. 13. The demeanour of the minor child as observed by the learned trial Court that the child victim on seeing the accused from the wooden partition when she correctly identified them seeks volume against the accused appellant and establishes the identity of the accused i.e. the appellant herein of being the perpetrator of the crime. 14. As regards, the contention raised on behalf of the appellant that there have been varying statements made by the minor child, it is essential to observe as laid down by the Honble Division Bench of this Court in CRL. REF. no. 2/2016 titled as COURT ON ITS OWN Crl.A.865/2019 MOTION VS. STATE, wherein it has been observed vide paragraph 84 to the effect- 15. As regards the aspect of the lack of corroboration to the testimony of the minor prosecutrix, it is essential to observe as laid down by the Honble Division Bench of this Court in Baljeet Singh Ors. Vs. State of Delhi and Ors. in Crl.A.386, 486, 487 and 1080/ 2011, the competency of a child witness to give evidence is not regulated by the age but by the degree of understanding he she appears to possess. The observations of the Honble Division Bench of this Court in Baljeet Singh and Ors. Vs. State of Delhi and Ors. supra in paragraphs 88, 89 90, which read to the effect- 90. One of the issues marring the growth of our country is the evil of child sexual abuse which we hear very often. The POCSO Act, 2013 was therefore formulated in order to effectively address the heinous crimes of sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children. There lies no iota of doubt that it takes great amount of grit and courage to distinctly explain the horrendous incident that a child is made to go through because of certain ruthless section of the society. A child however even at a tender age does possess the ability to answer the questions put to her him spontaneously if she he was present at the site of crime or if he she has been a victim herself. It is even the courts duty to be sensitive towards the child as the Crl.A.865/2019 courtroom proceedings are alien to him and it may have a more stressful and terrifying effect which may create a fear in his mind rendering him unable to speak about the incident. It is for the court to adjudge the grasping abilities of children, their tendency to fantasise and their susceptibility to coaching, which are certain factors that need careful examination on case to case basis. Therefore, the court must be satisfied that the attendant circumstances do not show that the child was acting under the influence of someone or was under a threat or coercion. Careful evaluation of the evidence of a child witness in the background of facts of each case in context of other evidence on record is inescapable before the court decides to rely upon it., are thus germane and relevant in the facts and circumstances of the instant case. 16. It is essential to observe that in the instant case the minor child witness is not a mere witness but is the victim herself and in such circumstances, it is apparent that her testimony is a vivid account of whatever took place with her. The verdict of the Honble Supreme Court in Nivrutti Pandurang Kokate and Ors. Vs. State of Maharashtra AIR 2008 SC 1460 categorically observes to the effect- 17. The facts and circumstances of the instant case clearly point out that the minor child victim C examined as PW-3 was picked up by the accused i.e. the appellant herein and was taken into the bushes wherein, he had taken off his underwear and taken off the childs Crl.A.865/2019 underwear and the accused i.e. the appellant herein inserted his penis into her vagina, as a consequence of which she bled profusely and on the child having screamed and shouted, he left and ran away. In the circumstances, the commission of kidnapping of the minor child by the accused i.e. the appellant herein from outside her house at X from the local guardianship of her parents and of having taken her to the Jhuggis of the area Y with intent that she may be compelled for illicit intercourse and of the appellant thereby thereafter having committed aggravated penetrative sexual assault upon the minor child aged 5 years at the time of the offence as established by exhibitPW4/B i.e. the birth certificate of the minor child giving her year of birth to be 2011 under [SECTION_UNK]m of the POCSO Act, 2012 punishable thus under [SECTION_UNK] of the POCSO Act, 2012, stands established beyond a reasonable doubt. 18. As regards the contention that had been raised on behalf of the prosecutrix that Ms. Z mentioned in the statement of the mother of the prosecutrix i.e. the counselor had not been cited as a witness nor examined by the Investigating Agency, it is essential to observe that as answered vide the CRL.REF. no.2/2016 in response to question no.1, which reads to the effect ii Provisions of the POCSO Act or the JJ Act do not contemplate any report to be made by a counsellor. It further makes it explicitly clear that counselling report notes of the counsellor as well as any person or expert recognized under the POCSO Act and Rules of 2012 and the JJ Act are confidential in nature and the same cannot be made a part of the chargesheet or otherwise on the trial court record., it is thus apparent that the counseling report notes of the counselor are confidential in nature and cannot be made a part of the charge sheet or otherwise in the Trial Court Record and thus, in these circumstances, the non production of the counselor as a prosecution witness does not detract from the veracity of the prosecution version. 19. In the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the records bring forth that the learned Trial Court has carefully scrutinized the entire available record to arrive at the conclusion in believing the testimony of the minor prosecutrix and there is no reason not to believe her testimony that the appellant herein was the sole perpetrator of the commission of the crime. 20. In view thereof, it is apparent that there is no merit in the appeal, in as much as the testimony of all the prosecution witnesses, are consistent and cogent in relation to all material particulars. 21. In the circumstances, the conviction of the appellant for the proved commission of the offences punishable under [SECTION] and [SECTION_UNK] of the POCSO Act, 2012 is Crl.A.865/2019 established and the appellant has been rightly so convicted by the learned Trial Court vide judgment dated 22.03.2019. 22. The learned Trial Court taking into account the age of the appellant being 30 years, with the responsibility of an old aged mother and previous clean antecedents has apparently already taken a lenient view by imposition of only a sentence of Rigorous Imprisonment for a period of 10 years and to pay a fine of rs.10,000/- and in default of the payment of the fine to further undergo Simple Imprisonment for a period of six months. Thus, in the facts and circumstances of the instant case, there is no ground for variance of the sentence imposed vide the impugned order on sentence dated 23.03.2019 also. 23. However, in terms of the verdict of Supreme Court in Phul Singh Vs. State of Haryana in Criminal Appeal no. 506/1979 decided on 10.09.1979 and directions laid down by us in Sanjay vs State 2017 III AD Delhi 24 dated 20.02.2017 so that the carceral period reforms the convict as also reiterated by this Court in Randhir Malang vs State Crl. A. no.456/2017, Chattu Lal vs State Crl.A. no.524/ 2017, Afzal vs State Govt. of NCT of Delhi Crl.A. No .996/2016, Billo Vs. State NCT of Delhi in Crl. A.378/2017 Dinesh Chand Vs. State Govt. of NCT of Delhi in Crl.A. no.330/2018, it is essential that the following directives detailed hereunder are given so that the sentence acts as a deterrent and is simultaneously reformative with a prospect of rehabilitation. 24. The concerned Superintendent at the Tihar Jail, New Delhi where the appellant shall be incarcerated for the remainder of the term Crl.A.865/2019 of imprisonment as hereinabove directed shall consider an appropriate programme for the appellant ensuring, if feasible 25. Furthermore, it is directed that a Bi annual report is submitted by the Superintendent, Tihar Jail, New Delhi to this Court till the date of release, of the measures being adopted for reformation and rehabilitation of the appellant. 26. Vide the order on sentence, the Secretary DSLSA, North West had been directed to consider the grant of adequate compensation to Crl.A.865/2019 the victim after considering the nature of the offence and the family circumstances, and the report of the Secretary DSLSA in relation to the compensation so paid is also called for qua the aspect of the grant of compensation paid and the matter be put up on receipt of the same. 27. The Member Secretary DSLSA shall ensure that the compensation paid to the minor child shall be in terms of the NALSAs Compensation Scheme for Women Victims Survivors of Sexual Assault other Crimes-2018 in accordance with the guidelines as directed vide the order dated 05.09.2018 of the Honble Supreme Court in Nipun Saxena Anr. Vs. Union of India Ors. in W.P.C no.565/2012. 28. The present appeal and the accompanying application Crl.M. B1312/2019 are thus, dismissed. 29.

      "1. This Regular Second Appeal under [SECTION] 1908 impugns the Judgment of the First Appellate Court dated 26.9.2014. The First Appellate Court vide its Judgment dated 26.9.2014 has decreed the suit by setting aside the Judgment of the Trial Court dated 15.12.2011 which had dismissed the suit. The subject suit was a suit for possession, mesne profits and injunction with respect to the suit property admeasuring 100 sq. yards bearing no. A-699, New Ashok Nagar, Delhi, situated in khasra no. 409/274. RSA no. 206/2015 2. The case of the respondent plaintiff was that he purchased ownership rights in the suit property by usual documentation being the Agreement to Sell, General Power of Attorney, Will, Receipts, etc dated 12.6.1997. Out of 100 sq. yards, 30 sq. yards were purchased by the respondent plaintiff from Smt. Gyanwati and 35 sq. yards each were purchased from Sh. Prabhu Dayal and Sh. Rakesh Kashyap. The appellant defendant is alleged to have trespassed illegally and taken possession of one shop and two rooms in the year 2001 shop being the area which was purchased from Smt. Gyanwati and two rooms being the area purchased from Sh. Prabhu Dayal. Firstly a legal notice was sent to the appellant defendant in the year 2001 which led to sitting of a Panchayat whereby the appellant defendant was to handover possession which he failed to do so, and therefore, after serving another Legal Notice on 8.2.2007 the subject suit was filed. 3. The defence of the appellant defendant was that the suit property was not owned by the respondent plaintiff because the suit property was acquired by the government by Award nos. 39 and 22 and possession was also taken by the government. The acquisition proceedings and the possession proceedings were of 1982-83. Accordingly, it was prayed that since the respondent plaintiff was not the owner the suit should be dismissed. RSA no. 206/2015 4. After the pleadings were complete, the trial court on 21.2.2009 framed the following issues- 5. Before the trial court the respondent plaintiff proved the entire chain of documentation i.e from his sellers, namely, Smt. Gyanwati, Sh. Prabhu Dayal and Sh. Rakesh Kashyap and also from the predecessors in-interest of Smt. Gyanwati, Sh. Prabhu Dayal and Sh. Rakesh Kashyap. These documents have been proved and exhibited and is so noted accordingly in paragraph 6 of the judgment of the trial court and which reads as under- 6. Appellant defendant also led evidence of acquisition and possession proceedings qua the Government and which evidence is referred to in paragraph 7 of the judgment of the trial court and the same reads as under- 7. Trial court dismissed the suit holding that since the suit land is proved to have been acquired by the government, and which acquisition and possession proceedings are of the year 1982-83, therefore the respondent plaintiff by his documents of 1997 could not claim title to the suit property. Accordingly, the suit for possession was dismissed. 8. The first appellate court by an elaborate, exhaustive, thorough and well reasoned judgment has set aside the judgment of the trial court and held that even if the respondent plaintiff failed to show his title because the suit land RSA no. 206/2015 was acquired by the Government, respondent plaintiff proved his possessory title to the suit property and therefore he was entitled to succeed on the basis of the possessory title as against the world at large except the true owner, and that respondent plaintiff could succeed against the appellant defendant as the appellant defendant was not the true owner. Ordinarily, I would have given detailed reasoning to uphold the judgment of the first appellate court, but, in my opinion, since the first appellate court has passed a very exhaustive and thorough judgment, and possibly even I cannot do any better so far as language is concerned, I seek to reproduce relevant paragraphs being paragraph nos. 9 to 20 of the judgment of the first appellate court, and which read as under- 9. I completely agree with the discussion, reasoning and conclusion of the first appellate court because Article 64 of the Limitation Act, 1963 , 1963 provides that there is a period of twelve years for filing of a suit on the basis of possessory title. [SECTION] and can be filed within twelve years of the date of dispossession. It is not in dispute that the subject suit has been filed RSA no. 206/2015 within twelve years of date of dispossession of the respondent plaintiff claiming possessory title and therefore the first appellate court was completely justified in decreeing the suit on the basis of prior possessory title of the respondent plaintiff and because appellant defendant failed to prove any ownership title or possessory title of the suit property as against the respondent plaintiff. I also note that the first appellate court has exhaustively referred to various documents which were proved by the respondent plaintiff being the chain of title documents of respondent plaintiff from the previous persons who claim ownership and therefore possessory title with respect to the suit property. These documents were exhibited as exhibitPW1/1 to exhibitPW1/20 before the trial court. In paragraph 18 of its judgment, the first appellate court has further referred to LPG gas connection obtained by respondent plaintiff on 21.1.1998 vide exhibitPW1/42, electricity connection in 1999 as per the documents exhibitPW1/28 to exhibitPW1/33, water connection in February, 2000 as per documents exhibitPW1/34 and exhibitPW1/35 as also filing of income tax returns since August, 2000 vide exhibitPW1/45 and the property tax payment receipt exhibitPW1/38. All these documents refer to the address of the suit property being that of the respondent plaintiff and therefore showing possession of the respondent plaintiff of the suit property. RSA no. 206/2015 10. The only way in which respondent plaintiff could have been dislodged was by the appellant defendant showing possessory title prior to 1997, but on this aspect the appellant defendant miserably failed and which is rightly held in paragraphs 17 and 20 of the judgment of the first appellate court, which are reproduced above. The first appellate court rightly notes that except a simple self serving statement no documentary evidence or any other credible evidence was led by the appellant defendant with respect to his possession being a prior possession before 1997 when the respondent plaintiff acquired, if not ownership title, but at least possessory title of the suit property. 11. The first appellate court has noted in paragraph 22 of its judgment the peculiarity which prevails in Delhi that various colonies have come up on government land, and such colonies running into hundreds have been regularized by government, and that the suit land is situated in one such unauthorized colony which is in the process of being regularized by government. In any case, dehors regularization aspect the only person who can claim possession from the respondent plaintiff would be the government on the basis of ownership but not appellant defendant who has no title and not even prior possessory title than the respondent plaintiff. 12. Learned counsel for the appellant defendant has sought to place reliance upon the judgment titled as Union of India and Others Vs. Vasavi Co RSA no. 206/2015 op. Housing Society Ltd. and Others, 2014 1 SCALE 126 to argue that in a suit for declaration of title and possession, title has to be clearly proved to succeed for possession, however, this judgment has no application in the facts of the present case because the first appellate court has not proceeded to grant relief to the respondent plaintiff on the basis of ownership title but has granted reliefs on the basis of possessory title of the respondent plaintiff being better than the illegal possession and occupation of the appellant defendant as against the respondent plaintiff. 13. In view of the above, there is no merit in this second appeal. No substantial question of law arises. Since the appellant defendant has illegally dispossessed the respondent plaintiff and which respondent plaintiff has been forced to incur costs of litigation till this second appeal, this Regular Second Appeal is dismissed with costs of rs.25,000/-. Costs shall be paid by the appellant defendant to the respondent plaintiff within a period of four weeks from today.\n",

      "1. Issue notice. Mr.Ruchir Mishra, Advocate accepts notice on behalf of the respondent. Counsel for the respondent waives his right to file a reply to the petition and submits that the petition can be heard on the basis of the record that has been filed with the petition. 2. Counsel for the respondent submits that having checked the records, he does not deny that the Impugned Award was served on the petitioner only on 8th November, 2017. Accordingly, the present petition would be within the period of limitation as provided under [SECTION_UNK] of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 , 1996. 3. This petition under [SECTION] , 1996, has been filed by the petitioner challenging OMPCOMM 87/2018 page 1 the Arbitral Award dated 5th July, 2017 passed by the Sole Arbitrator awarding certain claims in favour of the respondent along with interest. 4. The disputes between the parties arose out of the failure of the petitioner to complete the work of construction of dwelling units including allied services for Officers, JCOs OR RRC Line, OD Line, Rasponja, Hasting Line, Dakshnishwar at Kolkata awarded by the respondent in favour of the petitioner vide Agreement dated 31.01.2011. The petitioner having delayed the completion of the work, the agreement was terminated by the respondent on 31st May, 2013. Upon such termination of the agreement, the respondent proceeded to award the balance work to M s K.Tech Engineer Builders Co. Pvt. Ltd. at the risk and cost of the petitioner on 29th August, 2014. 5. The respondent raised the following claims before the Arbitrator 78. Revised Amount of Claim no.1. The Claimant vide letter no. 81974/MAP PH-11/PKG-19/1 B ARB/72/E8 dated 15 Jun 17 submitted revised amount of Claim no. 1 as under a Final Bill amount rs.54,67,59,241.52- ii Encashment of Performance Guarantee rs.3,24,50,000.00 iii Press Advertisment Charges rs.13,134.00- iv Compensation For Less Tech Staff Engr rs.71,33,067.00- v Delay in submission of CPM Chart rs.16,96,000.00- vi Expenditure on preparation of Final Bill rs.10,000.00 - vii CILQ Charges rs.11,44,96,200.00- TOTAL rs.63,76,57,642.52- OMPCOMM 87/2018 page 2 6. The petitioner was proceeded ex parte by the Sole Arbitrator as it failed to appear before the Arbitrator in spite of several notices. 7. The first contention raised by the counsel for the petitioner is that at the inception of the arbitration proceedings, the petitioner had challenged the authority of the Sole Arbitrator to proceed with the arbitration as the Arbitrator was an officer of the respondent Armed Forces. She submits that in terms of [SECTION_UNK] of the Act, the Arbitrator is mandated to decide on such objection first before proceeding with the arbitration. She submits that in the present case, the Arbitrator did not decide the objection raised by the petitioner during the arbitration proceedings, but decided the same only with the Impugned Award. She submits that this itself is a ground for setting aside the Impugned Award. 8. On the other hand, counsel for the respondent draws my attention to the summary of various proceedings before the Arbitrator as recorded in the Impugned Award itself. He submits that the petitioner was playing hide and seek with the Arbitrator inasmuch as it appeared once and then thereafter chose not to appear. He further submits that the objection raised by the petitioner was vague in nature and, in fact, contrary to Clause 60 of the General Conditions of Contract by which the petitioner had given its consent to appointment of a serving officer as an Arbitrator for adjudicating the disputes between the parties. He submits and it is denied by the counsel for the petitioner that as the arbitration proceedings had commenced prior to coming into force of the Arbitration and Conciliation OMPCOMM 87/2018 page 3 Amendment Act , 2015, the law as prevailing then would be applicable. He submits that prior to the amendment of the Act, even a serving officer could be appointed as an Arbitrator, provided he had not dealt with the subject matter of the dispute. He submits that the petitioner never raised any objection on this ground and in fact, the Arbitrator, in paragraph 9 of the Impugned Award, has categorically recorded that he had no interest in the dispute nor had he dealt with the case earlier in his official Code of Civil Procedure, 1882 1908 ity before entering upon the reference of the dispute. 9. I have considered the submissions made by the counsels for the parties. Though it is correct that the Arbitrator should decide on the objection raised by the party to the dispute with respect to his authority, before proceeding further with the arbitration proceedings, however, in the present case, it is seen that the challenge to the authority of the Arbitrator was only on the ground that he is a serving officer of the respondent Armed Forces and as such is ineligible to continue as an Arbitrator. It is also noticed that prior to the appointment of the Sole Arbitrator who has passed the Impugned Award, another Arbitrator had been appointed by the respondent. Similar objection to such appointment had been taken by the petitioner, however, the said Arbitrator had also proceeded with the proceedings before resigning from his position as an Arbitrator on 29th February, 2016. The present Arbitrator was appointed by the respondent on 27th May, 2016 and he gave his consent to such appointment on 21st June, 2016 calling upon the parties to file their respective pleadings. The petitioner raised an objection against his OMPCOMM 87/2018 page 4 appointment vide letter dated 5th October, 2016, however, forwarded their memo of appearance on 18th October, 2016 to the Arbitrator. Thereafter, on the statement of claim being filed by the respondent, the petitioner also sought a direction from the Arbitrator for the respondent to supply a number of documents listed in the Statement of Claim. Such direction was issued by the Arbitrator on 28 th October, 2016. Thereafter, though the petitioner did not appear before the Arbitrator, it again sent an authorization in favour of one Mr.K.Anil Kumar Reddy, Director of the petitioner to appear before the Arbitrator. It also made a request for supply of further documents vide letter dated 19th November, 2016 so as to enable it to proceed further in the arbitration proceedings. Finally, in its letter dated 23rd November, 2016, the petitioner again raised an objection about the authority of the Arbitrator to act as such as he was an ex employee with the Armed Forces. Though, this letter is not on record, the Arbitrator has reproduced some portion of the same in paragraph 19 of the Impugned Award. The letter had stated that the petitioner would be challenging the authority of the Arbitrator before an appropriate Forum. On being asked whether any petition challenging the authority of the Arbitrator to proceed with the arbitration proceedings had been filed by the petitioner in any Court or otherwise, counsel for the petitioner submits that no such proceedings were filed by the petitioner. As noted above, the petitioner also chose to remain absent from the arbitration proceedings without any justified cause. 10. In view of the above, merely because the Arbitrator did not pass OMPCOMM 87/2018 page 5 a formal order rejecting the challenge made by the petitioner to his authority to continue as an Arbitrator, it cannot be said that he committed an illegality which would vitiate the arbitration proceedings making the Impugned Award liable to be set aside in these proceedings on that ground alone. I may only reiterate that the law as prevailing prior to the amendment to the Act was that even a serving officer can act as an Arbitrator provided he has not dealt with the subject matter of the dispute. In Indian Oil Corporation Ltd. vs Raja Transport Private Limited 2009 8 SCC 520, Supreme Court reiterated the then prevailing law on this issue as under- 14. No party can say he will be bound by only one part of the agreement and not the other part, unless such other part is impossible of performance or is void being contrary to the provisions of the Act, and such part is severable from the remaining part of the agreement. The arbitration clause is a package which may provide for what disputes are arbitrable, at what stage the disputes are arbitrable, who should be the arbitrator, what should be the venue, what law would govern the parties, etc. A party to the contract cannot claim the benefit OMPCOMM 87/2018 page 6 of arbitration under the arbitration clause, but ignore the appointment procedure relating to the named arbitrator contained in the arbitration clause. 15. It is now well settled by a series of decisions of this Court that arbitration agreements in government contracts providing that an employee of the Department usually a high official unconnected with the work or the contract will be the arbitrator, are neither void nor unenforceable. xxxxxx 30. We find no bar under the new Act, for an arbitration agreement providing for an employee of a Government statutory corporation public sector undertaking which is a party to the contract, acting as an arbitrator. [SECTION_UNK] of the Act requires the Chief Justice or his designate, in appointing an arbitrator, to have due regard to 31. [SECTION_UNK] requires an arbitrator, when approached in connection with his possible appointment, to disclose in writing any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his independence or impartiality. [SECTION_UNK] enables the arbitrator being challenged if i the circumstances give rise to justifiable doubts as to his independence or impartiality, or ii he does not possess the qualifications agreed to by the parties. 32. [SECTION_UNK] requires the arbitrator to treat the parties with equality that is to say without bias and give each party full opportunity to present his case. Nothing in Sections 11 , 12 , 18 or other provision of the Act suggests that any provision in an arbitration agreement, naming the arbitrator will be invalid if OMPCOMM 87/2018 page 7 such named arbitrator is an employee of one of the parties to the arbitration agreement. 33. Sub section 2 of [SECTION_UNK] provides that parties are free to agree upon a procedure for appointment of arbitrators. Sub section 6 provides that where a party fails to act, as required under the procedure prescribed, the Chief Justice or his designate can take necessary measures. Sub section 8 gives the discretion to the Chief Justice his designate to choose an arbitrator suited to meet the requirements of a particular case. The said power is in no way intended to nullify a specific term of arbitration agreement naming a particular person as arbitrator. The power under sub section 8 is intended to be used keeping in view the terms of the arbitration agreement. 34. The fact that the named arbitrator is an employee of one of the parties is not ipso facto a ground to raise a presumption of bias or partiality or lack of independence on his particle There can however be a justifiable apprehension about the independence or impartiality of an employee arbitrator, if such person was the controlling or dealing authority in regard to the subject contract or if he is a direct subordinate as contrasted from an officer of an inferior rank in some other Department to the officer whose decision is the subject matter of the dispute. 35. Where however the named arbitrator though a senior officer of the Government statutory body government company, had nothing to do with the execution of the subject contract, there can be no justification for anyone doubting his independence or impartiality, in the absence of any specific evidence. Therefore, senior officers usually Heads of Department or equivalent of a Government statutory corporation public sector undertaking, not associated with the contract, are considered to be independent and impartial and are not barred from functioning as arbitrators merely because their employer is a party to the contract. OMPCOMM 87/2018 page 8 36. The position may be different where the person named as the arbitrator is an employee of a company or body or individual other than the State and its instrumentalities. For example, if the Director of a private company which is a party to the arbitration agreement, is named as the arbitrator there may be a valid and reasonable apprehension of bias in view of his position and interest, and he may be unsuitable to act as an arbitrator in an arbitration involving his company. If any circumstance exists to create a reasonable apprehension about the impartiality or independence of the agreed or named arbitrator, then the court has the discretion not to appoint such a person. 37. Subject to the said clarifications, we hold that a person being an employee of one of the parties which is the State or its instrumentality cannot per se be a bar to his acting as an arbitrator. Accordingly, the answer to the first question is that the learned Chief Justice was not justified in his assumption of bias. 11. On being asked if the petitioner had any knowledge of the Arbitrator having dealt with the subject matter of the dispute, the counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has no such knowledge. On the other hand, there is a categorical denial by the Arbitrator as recorded in paragraph 9 of the Impugned Award on this aspect. Therefore, I find no merit in the objection raised by the petitioner on this ground. 12. The second contention raised by the counsel for the petitioner is that the arbitrator has awarded the amounts in favour of the respondent without seeking any proof of the same. She submits that though the agreement between the parties empowered the respondent to complete the work at the risk and consequence of the petitioner, the OMPCOMM 87/2018 page 9 Arbitrator should have scrutinized the terms of the agreement between the respondent and M s K Tech Engineer Builders Co. Pvt. Ltd. to find out and determine whether any additional work had been granted in favour of the new contractor and as to whether the work awarded in favour of the new contractor was indeed the balance work that had remained to be executed by the petitioner. Counsel for the petitioner further submits that there were various other documents that were relevant for the purposes of adjudicating the claim of the respondent, however, they find no mention in the Impugned Award. These documents should also have been considered by the Arbitrator before passing the Impugned Award. 13. I am unable to agree with the submission made by the counsel for the petitioner. The Arbitrator in the Impugned Award records that the respondent has filed before it the agreement between the respondent and the petitioner as also the contract awarded in favour of M s K Tech Engineer Builders Co. Pvt. Ltd. As the petitioner had remained ex parte before the Arbitrator and even a response to the Statement of Claim had not been filed by it, there was no dispute before the Arbitrator that the agreement as awarded in favour of the new contractor is not for the balance work that had remained unexecuted by the petitioner. In absence of such a dispute being raised, it was not for the Arbitrator to have himself assumed such a dispute and to scrutinize the evidence as if to find loopholes in the same or to conduct a fishing and roving enquiry. Once the respondent had made a submission that the agreement executed by it with the new contractor was for the balance work and such assertion remained OMPCOMM 87/2018 page 10 unchallenged, the Arbitrator was entitled to pass an award on the basis of this submission, especially when the two contracts had been duly proved before the Arbitrator. 15. It is further contended by the counsel for the petitioner that in the present case, there is a duplication of amounts awarded in favour of the respondent by the Arbitrator. She submits that on the one hand, the Arbitrator has awarded compensation 10 of the agreement amount equalling to rs.6,48,77,451.99 while adjudicating Claim no.1a as Liquidated Damages, at the same time, the Arbitrator had also awarded an amount of rs.11,44,96,200/- in favour of the respondent as damages on the ground that the respondent had suffered this loss due to failure of the petitioner to timely complete the project of construction of the flats. 16. Counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, submits that the two claims are distinct and, therefore, there is no question of any duplication of the amounts awarded in favour of the respondent. 17. As far as this objection is concerned, I agree with the counsel for the petitioner. The damages in form of Cash in lieu of Quarter CILQ have been awarded in favour of the respondent under claim no. 1j for the period of delay in schedule date completion of the flats in the agreement with the petitioner and the schedule date of completion in the contract with the new contractor, that is for the period between 1st March, 2013 to 6th November, 2016. This, therefore, is clearly the actual damages suffered by the respondent due to delay in completion of the work. On the other hand, while granting claim no.1a, an amount of rs.6,48,77,451.99 has also been OMPCOMM 87/2018 page 11 awarded in favour of the respondent as liquidated damages. 18. [SECTION] provides as under- 16. It is to be noted that claim made under claim no.1j was the amount paid by the respondent to its officers who are not allotted Government accommodation. It was the claim of the respondent that due to delay in construction of the flats in question, it had to continue paying the CILQ to its officers between 1st March, 2013 that is the original date of completion of the work and 6th November, 2016 that is the stipulated date of completion of the work as mentioned in the contract with the subsequent contractor. This clearly was, therefore, damage suffered by the respondent, however, as the contract between the petitioner and the respondent provided for liquidated damages, the respondent could not have been held entitled to any amount in excess of the same and in any case not in addition to the same and the Award of claim no. 1j cannot be sustained. 21. It is further contented by the counsel for the petitioner that the Arbitrator has wrongly awarded damages for the delay in submission of Critical Part Method CPM charticle She submits that as the amount awarded is in form of liquidated damages penalty, the same could not have been awarded without proof of actual loss suffered by the respondent due to such delay. I am unable to agree with the said submission. Clause 3.11.2 of the agreement provides that any delay on part of the contractor to submit the CPM Network Diagram shall attract a penalty as provided therein. Before the Arbitrator, there was no dispute raised with respect to such delay in submitting CPM Network Diagram. Nor was an objection raised that the amount OMPCOMM 87/2018 page 14 mentioned in clause 3.1.2 is in form of penalty and not liquidated damages or is unreasonable. In absence of such assertions, the Arbitrator has rightly awarded the said amount in favour of the respondent. I place reliance on the judgment in Kailash Nath Associates supra. I, therefore, find no merit in the objection against the award of the amount in favour of the respondent under Claim no.1g. 22. It is lastly contended by the counsel for the petitioner that the amounts awarded in favour of the respondent being in form of damages, interest prior to the date of the award could not have been granted in favour of the respondent. This submission of the petitioner cannot be accepted as the Arbitrator has clearly recorded cogent reasons for award of such interest and from the dates that he has awarded such interest in favour of the respondent. I may only quote from paragraphs 103 and 104 of the Impugned Award as under a Pendent elite Interest. The Claimant has claimed an interest of 18 per annum on an amount of rs. 55,74,80,379.92 amount of original claim no. 1 of Claimant SOC, from the date of intimation to Respondent to deposit the money up to date of award. I find that the Claimant vide their letter dated 08 Sep 2014 Exhibit GC-47 had intimated to the Respondent to deposit the risk and cost amount The Claimant had asked for deposition of an amount of rs.37,70,00,000.00 and stated that this is an approximate amount and that the exact amount of recovery shall be known after completion of risk and cost contract. In view of the various submissions of the Claimant, my findings above, case laws relied upon as also the revised claim no.1. I direct the Respondent to pay simple interest 12 per annum on the amount of rs.37,70,00,000.00 from 08 Sep 2014 to 26 May 16 day prior to date of my appointment and simple interest 12 per annum on the amount awarded against revised claim no.1 i.e. rs.63,65,81,178.32 from 27 May 16 date of my appointment to the date of this award, in favour of the Claimant b Future Interest. I allow a time of 90 days to the Respondent, to pay to the Claimant the amounts set out as awards by me in favour of the. Claimant, failing which, the OMPCOMM 87/2018 page 16 Respondent shall also pay to the Claimant, simple interest 12 per annum on these amounts for the period to be reckoned from the day after the date of this award to the date on which the actual payment is made. 23. I, therefore, find no merit in the said objection of the petitioner. 24. In view of the above, the present petition is allowed only to the limited extent of setting aside the award of Claim no.1j in favour of the respondent and the consequential interest thereon, while upholding the remaining amounts awarded in the Impugned Award in favour of the respondent. There shall be no order as to costs.\n",

      "1. Process of criminal law was set into motion when at around 11.20 P.M. on 19.04.1999 ASI Dani Ram PW-4, noted vide daily diary entry exhibitPW-4/A, that one Anil Garg r o A-24, Adarsh Nagar, Rama Road, Delhi has informed over Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 telephone that his daughter Priyanka herein after referred to as the Deceased has been forcibly confined in a bathroom by her tutor that the door of the said bathroom is bolted from inside and that said person is not opening the door of the bathroom inspite of repeated knocking at the door. 2. Inspector Jeewan Singh Gill PW-18, was handed over a copy of the afore noted DD entry. Accompanied by Const.Bhura Singh PW-13, Const.Giri Kumar PW-14, Const.Mukesh PW-15 and SI Mukesh Kumar PW-17, Inspector Jeewan Singh Gill reached the house in question and what happened thereafter is recorded in the endorsement tehrir exhibitPW-16/A made by Inspector Jeewan Singh Gill PW-18, which reads as under- 3. The afore noted endorsement on basis whereof the FIR was registered was preceded by Inspector Jeewan Singh Gill PW-18, recording the statement exhibitPW-2/A of Anil Garg, the father of the deceased, gist whereof is that the deceased was a student of second year, St. Stephen college and that her marriage was to be solemnized on 28.04.1999. Accused Uttam Kumar used to give tuitions to his son Vibhor at his residence. On 19.04.1999 at around 09.30 P.M. the deceased and her mother returned to the house after shopping. At that time Uttam Kumar was teaching Vibhor in Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 a room on the first floor of the house. After keeping the things purchased by her in the house the deceased went to the room where the accused was teaching Vibhor. When the deceased entered Vibhors room, Vibhor went to the kitchen to drink water. Thereafter he i.e. Anil Garg along with Vibhor went to the room where the accused was teaching Vibhor. When he i.e. Anil Garg did not find the accused in the room he made inquiries from Vibhor about the whereabouts of the accused upon which Vibhor told him that the accused might be present in the bathroom attached to the said room. Thereafter he inquired about the deceased as she was nowhere to be seen in the house. When he and his family members could not find the deceased anywhere in the house a doubt arose in his mind that perhaps the accused may have locked the deceased and himself in the bathroom. The door of the bathroom was knocked and the accused responded and on being asked to open the door, the accused replied Since you are marrying the deceased with some other boy I have murdered her and that I would not open the door. Thereafter he informed the police about the aforesaid incident. 4. The statement exhibitPW-2/A on which the endorsement exhibitPW-16/A was made by Inspector Jeewan Singh Gill was forwarded at 01.30 A.M. on 20.04.1999 through Const.Giri Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 Kumar PW-14, to the police station for registration of an FIR where HC Veer Sen PW-16, registered FIR no.235/1999, exhibitPW-16/B. 5. As recorded in the endorsement exhibitPW-16/A, the appellant was apprehended at the spot. In fact, if the contents of the endorsement exhibitPW-16/A are correct, the accused was caught red handed. Inspector Jeewan Singh Gill PW-18, seized the knife recovered from the possession of the accused vide memo exhibitPW-2/4 as also prepared the sketch exhibitPW-2/3 of the said knife. Thereafter Inspector Jeewan Singh Gill seized the shirt and vest worn by the accused when he was apprehended vide memo exhibitPW-2/5. It may be noted that the seizure memo exhibitPW-2/5 records that three buttons of the shirt worn by the accused when he was apprehended were found to be broken. Inspector Jeewan Singh Gill prepared the site plan exhibitPW-18/1 of the house in question recording therein at points XA and XC the spots where the body of the deceased was lying and the accused was found standing in the bathroom respectively. 6. In the meantime, SI Ashok Kumar PW-11, Finger Print Expert, and Const.Yashpal PW-12, a photographer, reached the spot on being summoned. SI Ashok Kumar inspected the spot and prepared his report exhibitPW-11/A. The report exhibitPW- 11/A records that four chance prints were found on a Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 washing machine kept in the bathroom in question. It is also noteworthy that the report exhibitPW-11/A records that the time of the occurrence of the murder of the deceased was about 09.15 P.M. on 19.04.1999. 7. Const.Yashpal PW-12, took the photographs exhibitPW- 12/8 to exhibitPW-12/13 of the body of the deceased as also the bathroom where the body of the deceased was found negatives whereof are exhibitPW-12/1 to exhibitPW-12/7. It may be noted here that one photograph could not be developed. The photographs exhibitPW-12/12 and exhibitPW-12/13 depict the door from within the bathroom which opens into the bedroom. 8. The body was seized and sent to the mortuary, where on 20.04.1999, at about 11.35 A.M. Dr.Komal Singh PW-9, conducted the post mortem and prepared the report exhibitPW- 9/1. Following external injuries were found on the person of the deceased as recorded in the post mortem report exhibitPW- 9/A- 9. The post mortem report exhibitPW-9/1 further records that the cause of death of the deceased was shock resulting from injuries Nos.1 and 2 found on the person of the deceased that all the injuries found on the person were ante mortem in nature and that the death of the deceased had taken place about 12 hours before the conduct of the post mortem. 10. The knife recovered from the possession of the accused at the time of his arrest was also sent to the mortuary along with the body of the deceased for purposes of obtaining opinion of the doctor regarding the weapon of offence. Dr.Komal Singh PW-9 examined the said knife and gave his opinion exhibitPW-9/2 which inter alia records that the Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 injuries Nos.1 and 2 found on the person of the deceased could have been caused by the said knife. The opinion exhibitPW-9/2 has been penned at the rear page of the post mortem report on which the sketch of the knife has also been drawn by Dr.Komal Singh. 11. After conducting the post mortem, Dr.Komal Singh handed over the blood sample of the deceased on a gauze and the clothes of the deceased to Const.Bhoora Singh PW- 13 and Const.Giri Kumar PW-14, and the same were seized by the investigating officer vide memo exhibitPW-13/1 when the two handed over the same to the investigating officer. For record it may be noted here itself that on 12.07.1999 Dr.Komal Singh gave a second opinion exhibitPW-9/3 regarding the weapon of offence the opinion being that the injuries nos.3 to 8 found on the person of the deceased could have been caused by the knife recovered from the possession of the accused. 12. The clothes and blood sample of the deceased the knife recovered from the possession of the accused and the shirt and vest worn by the accused at the time when he was arrested were sent to the Forensic Science Laboratory for serological examination. 13. Vide FSL reports exhibitPW-18/9/, exhibitPW-18/9/3 and exhibitPW-18/9/4, it was opined that the blood group of the Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 deceased was O that human blood of O group was found on the shirt worn by the accused at the time of his arrest human blood of the same group was detected on the clothes of the deceased and the knife recovered from the possession of the accused. It was further opined that human blood was detected on the vest worn by the accused at the time of his arrest, group whereof could not be determined. 14. The four chance prints found in the bathroom where the body of the deceased was found dead and the specimen finger prints of the accused were sent to the Finger Print Bureau for comparison. Vide report exhibitPW-1/A it was opined that one of the chance prints found in the bathroom in question is identical with the finger print of the accused. 15. Statements of family members of the deceased present in the house were recorded, all of whom inculpated the appellant. 16. Armed with the aforesaid materials, the police filed a charge sheet against the accused. 17. In a nutshell, the case set up by the prosecution against the appellant was that the appellant who was the tutor of the deceased and her brothers developed a liking for the deceased. When the appellant learnt that the deceased is getting married he got enraged and murdered the Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 deceased by indiscriminately stabbing her in the bathroom in her house. 18. Before proceeding to note the evidence led at the trial, it is most important to note certain facts which were pressed into aid by learned counsel for the State to show, as per the State, the crafty mind of the appellant. 19. During the trial, the appellant filed an application dated 06.09.2005 under [SECTION] . praying that the official record maintained at Tihar Jail pertaining to the meetings held between the jail inmates and the visitors between the period 21.04.1999 to 09.05.2000 be summoned. Along with the said application, written arguments were also filed by the appellant detailing the reasons for summoning the said record. It may be noted here that the application dated 06.09.2005 is at page 1201 of the trial court record whereas the arguments filed by the appellant in support of the said application are at page 787 of the trial court record. It may further be noted that the said two documents are not drafted by the counsel of the appellant but are penned by the appellant himself in his own hand. 20. It is significant to note that the written arguments filed by the appellant in support of the application dated 06.09.2005 records that between the period 21.04.1999 to 09.05.2000 one Tinnu Tinny, the lover of the deceased, Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 accompanied by his two friends named Raj and Suresh visited him in Tihar Jail. During the said visits, Tinny told him that on 19.04.1999 he met the deceased in a market. Seeing the deceased in the company of Tinny, the mother of the deceased who was also present in the market got enraged and forcibly took the deceased to her residence. On the same day i.e. 19.04.1999 at about 08.10 P.M. Tinny received a SMS from a servant employed at the house of the deceased to the effect that the deceased tried to commit suicide when her family members forced her to end her relationship with Tinny. Tinny handed over the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 written by the deceased to him. 21. Relevant would it be to note that the order dated 03.12.2005 passed by the learned Trial Court records that the jail meeting record sought to be summoned by the accused has been weeded out by the jail authorities. 22.

The relevant portion of the letter exhibitDW-4/6 reads as under- 26. The relevant portion of the letter exhibitDW-4/7 reads as under- 27. The relevant portion of the letter exhibitDW-4/8 reads as under- 28. A reading of the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 brings out that whosoever Tinnu Tinny was, if the letters were in the hand of the deceased, the two were emotionally involved at some point of time but relations had soured. 29. During the trial, the appellant wrote numerous letters to the family members of the deceased including the letters exhibitDW-5/PA and exhibitDW-5/PB which he admitted as having written by him when he was cross examined as DW-5 appellant having chosen to examine himself as his own witness. 30. The letter exhibitDW-5/PA is addressed to the mother of the deceased i.e. Uma Garg.

He denied the suggestion that the appellant used to come to his house at 5-6 P.M. to teach Vibhor.

When the door in question was not opened inspite of repeated knocking at the door, the police officers present at the spot broke open the door upon which he saw that the deceased was lying dead in the bathtub kept in the bathroom and that the appellant who was holding a knife in his hand was standing in the corner of the bathroom. Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 He seized the knife recovered from the possession of the appellant and the shirt and vest worn by the appellant when he was apprehended vide memos exhibitPW-2/4 and exhibitPW-2/5 respectively.

The door of the bathroom was not seized by us. It is wrong to suggest that the door of the bathroom was not seized by the police because it was not broken. On being questioned about the photographs of the place of occurrence, he stated Quote The photographer had gone inside the bathroom before the crime team had gone inside the bathroom and had taken the photographs. The photographer was from the police department.Another photographer of the crime team had come along with the crime team.

Additionally, he deposed that the police had seized the knife recovered from the possession of the appellant in his presence. On being questioned about the time of the occurrence, he stated Quote It is correct that I have stated in my examination in-chief that the occurrence took place at 9.30 pm on 19-4-99.

On being confronted with the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 he denied that the said letters were written by his sister. The suggestions pertaining to false implication of the appellant which were put to Anil Garg were also put to him and the same were categorically denied by him. Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 44. It is significant to note here that save and except giving general suggestions pertaining to the false implication of the appellant and that the appellant used to give tuition to Vibhor at 5-6 P.M. during the days of the murder of the deceased, Vibhor has not been subjected to any cross examination with respect to essential portion of his testimony and in particular his statement that the appellant was giving him tuition in the night at around 900 PM. 45. In his examination under [SECTION] . the appellant denied everything and pleaded false implication. The defence put forward by the appellant was that he was teaching the deceased and her brothers Varun and Vibhor since last ten years and that he used to treat them as his own children. He had helped the father of the deceased i.e. Anil Garg when an income tax raid was conducted at his house and also when he got involved in connection with a case registered under the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 . He had extremely close relations with the family of the deceased. On one occasion the deceased told him that she was having an affair with a boy named Tinny Tinu upon which he advised her to disclose the said fact to her parents. He further claimed that the deceased told him that she had married Tinny. He claimed that on 19.04.1999 the deceased Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 met Tinny in the market and that the said fact came to the knowledge of her family. On the same day i.e. 19.04.1999 between 05.00 P.M. to 06.00 P.M. he was present in the house of the deceased to give tuitions to Vibhor and thereafter he returned to his house. He claimed that at about 09.30 P.M. the security guard of the family of the deceased came to his house and told him that father of the deceased has called him to his house, upon which he went to the house of the deceased. On reaching there, the father of the deceased told him that he and his son Vibhor had murdered the deceased in a fit of fury as she refused to end her relationship with Tinny and marry the boy of their choice. The father of the deceased asked him to take blame for the murder of the deceased and that when he refused to oblige him he got angry and pushed him inside the bathroom where the deceased was lying dead and closed the door of the bathroom from outside. With the help of M.R. Singhal, M.L.A. and the DGP of the area, the family of the deceased got him falsely implicated in the present case. While he was lodged in jail, Tinny accompanied by some persons came to meet him and handed over the letters exhibitDA to exhibitDH written by the deceased to Tinny. 46. In support of his defence, besides examining himself, the appellant examined four witnesses. Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 47. The appellant examined himself as DW-5. In his testimony, the appellant reiterated the defence taken by him in his examination under [SECTION] . Additionally, he deposed that he used to give tuitions to the children of the brother of the deceased namely Udit and Niati and many other children of the relatives of the family of the deceased. Mr.Mangat Ram Singhal who was the M.L.A. of Adarsh Nagar constituency was the maternal uncle of the father of the deceased. Two months prior to the incident, Mangat Ram Singhal requested him to teach the children of his household but he declined to do so because of shortage of time. Mangat Ram Singhal also requested him to help him in the elections held in the year 1998 but he refused to do so. Due to the said two reasons, Mangat Ram Singhal was annoyed with him. At the time when he reached the house of the deceased on being called by her father, besides the parents and brothers of the deceased, other family members of the deceased namely Darshana Garg, Shish Pal Garg, Satish Garg, Sunil Garg, Sangeeta Garg, Anita Garg, Udit, Niati, Ashotush, Soni and Siddharth were present there. Besides the aforesaid family members, servants employed at the residence of the deceased namely Manoj, Sita Ram, Raju and Hari were also present there. When he was lodged in jail, Tinny Tinnu along with his two friends Raj and Suresh Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 visited him and told him that on 19.04.1999 he i.e. Tinnu had met the deceased in the market. When the mother of the deceased saw the deceased in his company, she got very annoyed and forcibly dragged the deceased from the market. After sometime Tinny received a telephonic call from a servant employed at the house of the deceased who told him that the family members of the deceased had killed the deceased when she refused to end her affair with Tinny. Tinny assured him that he would help him in getting acquitted in the present case but since that day he has not heard a word from Tinny. He apprehends that Tinny has been kidnapped or murdered by the family of the deceased. The police falsely implicated him in the present case at the instance of Mangat Ram Singhal. On 19.04.1999 he witnessed Mangat Ram Singhal handing over bundle of notes to Inspector Jeewan Singh Gill at the residence of the deceased. The door of the bathroom which was bolted from outside was opened by Mangat Ram Singhal. When he was lodged in jail, he was forced to write letters addressed to family members of the deceased. 48. On being confronted with the letters exhibitDW-5/PA and exhibitDW-5/PB the appellant admitted that the same were written by him. Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 49. Gautam Sharma DW-1, the elder brother of the appellant, deposed that the appellant used to go to the house of the father of the deceased to teach his children. On 19.04.1999 he saw that a servant employed at the house of the deceased told the accused that the father of the deceased had called him immediately to his house upon which the appellant left for the house of the deceased. In the early morning of 20.04.1999 he left Delhi in connection with his business. When he returned to Delhi after four days he came to know that the appellant has been implicated in a murder case. The relations between him and the appellant were strained. On being questioned about the servant who had come to call the appellant, he stated Quote I never accompanied Uttam Kumar to the house of Anil Garg nor I ever separately visited that house.The person who had come to call accused Uttam Kumar at earlier also came to call Uttam Kumar on 3 to 4 occasions to go to his house. 50. Raghunath Prasad DW-2, Administrative Officer, St.Stephens college, produced the admission form exhibitPW- 2/A of the deceased and deposed that the said form is required to be filled by the student in his her own handwriting. 51. Marianus Jojo DW-3 deposed that in response to the summons issued by the Court to the Principal of Mont Fort Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 School, Ashok Vihar, he was directed to submit the letter exhibitDW-3/A which was signed by the Principal. It appears that the appellant had wanted production of some record pertaining to the deceased from the said school, which was not available with the school. 52. Dr.Deepa Verma DW-4, Senior Scientific Officer, FSL deposed that she had compared handwritings contained in the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 with the admitting handwriting of the deceased and that the handwriting contained in the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/10, exhibitDW- 4/12 and exhibitDW-4/13 is that of the deceased. 53. Holding the fact that the appellant was found standing in the bathroom where the deceased was found dead with a knife in his hand when the door of the said bathroom was broken coupled with the fact that the prosecution has been able to establish that the appellant had a motive to murder the deceased, for there was evidence on record to show that the appellant had a lust for the deceased and that he could not fathom that the deceased was getting married to someone else, vide impugned judgment and order dated 07.03.2007 the learned Trial Judge has convicted the appellant of having committed the murder of the deceased. In coming to the conclusion that the appellant had a lust for the deceased, the learned Trial Judge has held that the fact Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 that the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 were produced by the appellant and that his explanation as to how he came into possession of the said letters was unsatisfactory, for the appellant failed to establish the existence of Tinny Tinnu and the fact claimed by him that Tinny Tinnu handed over the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 to him, leads to a conclusion that Tinny Tinnu is no one else but the appellant himself. The learned Trial Judge rejected the defence taken by the appellant on the ground that it is highly improbable that the father and brother of the deceased would have murdered the deceased in such a brutal and gruesome manner. Vide order dated 15.03.2007, the learned Trial Judge had sentenced the appellant to undergo imprisonment for life and pay fine in sum of rs.5,00,000/- in default to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of five years for committing the offence punishable under [SECTION] . Conscious of the fact that life convicts are entitled to be considered for premature release after serving an actual sentence of 14 years, the learned Trial Judge has held that as and when the issue of premature release of the appellant is to be considered by the Board, the brutality of the murder and the pollution of the pious relationship between the teacher and the taught be brought to the notice of the Board. It is apparent that the purport of Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 the order of sentence is that the appellant should remain for the entire life in jail and not be released premature. 54. Conscious of the fact that the appellant has transposed his defence into the citadel of the prosecution i.e. by claiming entrapment, the appellant has ostensibly tried to get away to explain his presence in the house when the police came and his fingerprint being detected inside the bathroom where the dead body of deceased was recovered. The central issue, on which the debate has to take place, is whether the defence of entrapment has to succeed or the witnesses of the prosecution have to be believed. 55. At the hearing of the appeal filed by the appellant, following arguments were advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant A Firstly, unlike the burden upon the prosecution to prove the guilt, the accused has only to probablize the defence. In the backdrop of the above legal position, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there are several discrepancies in the case of the prosecution which strongly probablize the defence of the appellant that he was entrapped. i With reference to the seizure memo exhibitPW-2/5 which records that the shirt worn by the appellant which was seized when he was arrested was minus 3 buttons, learned counsel urged that from said fact it could Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 be gathered that a scuffle had taken place during which 3 buttons of the shirt of the appellant broke and fell down. No attempt being made to recover the broken buttons was a deliberate act of Insp.J.S.Gill for the reason if the buttons were found outside the bathroom it would have established a scuffle outside the bathroom which would be as per the claim of the appellant that when he was summoned to the house, the father and the brother of the deceased requested him to own up for the crime and take money and when he refused, they pushed him inside the bathroom where the dead body of the deceased was lying. ii Secondly, with reference to the testimony of the police officers namely Const.Bhoora Singh PW-13, Const.Giri Kumar PW-14, Const.Mukesh PW-15, SI Mukesh Kumar PW-17 and Inspector Jeewan Singh PW-18, as also the family members of the deceased namely Anil Garg PW-2, Varun Garg PW-3, Uma Garg PW-10 and Vibhor Garg PW-19 it was urged that all of them claimed that the door of the bathroom was broken into. If this be so, learned counsel urged that it was unexplainable that neither the broken door nor the broken bolt was seized. Referring to the photographs exhibitPW-12/12 and exhibitPW-12/13 which depicted the door of the bathroom from inside the bathroom, learned counsel pointed out that the door as also the latch bolt was intact. Therefrom, Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 counsel urged, an inference could be drawn that the door was locked from outside as claimed by the appellant after he was pushed inside and when the police came, the outside lock was removed and the appellant was apprehended after being entrapped. iii Thirdly, it was submitted that there was a mismatch between the shirt and the vest pertaining to the place where the two were stained with blood. It was urged that most of the stains on the vest were at places where corresponding staining of the shirt was not to be seen. Thus, it was a case of deliberately plating stains on the shirt and the vest of the appellant. iv Fourthly, it was urged that the opinion exhibitPW-9/3 was obtained from Dr.Komal Singh under duress, who admittedly gave opinion exhibitPW-9/2 at the first instance only with reference to injury no.1 and 2 and opined that the two could be caused by the knife in question. For the reason, the other 6 injuries were not possibly caused by the knife in question, Dr.Komal Singh deliberately did not give, on being so pressurized, any opinion. Surprisingly, while giving the opinion exhibitPW-9/3 Dr.Komal Singh opined without even looking to the knife. Further, injury no.8 which was sickle shaped could not be caused by the knife in question. It was submitted that it was apparent that two weapons were used and this probablized the defence that the father and the brother of the deceased Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 inflicted the injuries on her. v Fifthly, it was urged that the father of the deceased admitted during cross examination that Satish Garg, his brother, resided on the ground floor. Counsel urged that in the peculiar facts of the instant case it was apparent that material witnesses were withheld. vi Lastly, on the issue it was urged that since the family members of the deceased knew that it was a case of entrapment and a local MLA was related to them, using political influence, a thoughtful plan was conceived of which could be evidenced by the fact that as against the normal practice of sending two or three police officers when information is received about a crime being committed, in the instant case 6 police officers went to the spot for the obvious reason it was all pre planned. B The second submission advanced by learned counsel for the appellant was that the conduct of the parents and brothers of the deceased at the time of the occurrence was most unnatural and that the same casts a serious doubt on the veracity of their evidence. The first instance pointed out by the learned counsel was that Vibhor PW-19, deposed that the incident in question occurred at about 09.30 P.M. Counsel also drew attention of the court to the recording contained in the crime team report exhibitPW-11/A that the time of occurrence was 9.30 P.M. Counsel drew attention of the Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 court to the fact that the police was informed about the incident at 11.10 P.M. as recorded in DD entry, exhibitPW-4/1. Counsel submitted that the fact that the parents and brothers of the deceased took about 1 hour 40 minutes to inform the police about the incident strongly suggests that they bought time to cook up a false story before informing the police. Taking the argument a little further, counsel pointed out that the fact that when the parents and brothers of the deceased knocked the door of the bathroom in question as claimed by them and the appellant informed them as claimed by them that he had murdered the deceased as they were getting her married to someone else, said fact should have found mention in DD entry exhibitPW-4/1 and the absence thereof shows that the story cooked up by them is false. The second instance of the alleged unnatural conduct pointed by the learned counsel was that Anil Garg PW-2 and Varun Garg PW-3, deposed that they did not make an attempt to break open the door of the bathroom where the deceased was locked and that there was a gap of 20-30 minutes between the time when the factum of locking of the deceased in the bathroom came to their knowledge and the time of arrival of the police at the spot. According to the counsel, despite the fact that the parents and brothers of the deceased knew that the life of the deceased was in great Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 danger, for according to them the appellant had told them that he had murdered the deceased as they were getting her married to someone else, their conduct of not attempting to break open the door of the bathroom in question for a period of 20-30 minutes and instead keep waiting for the police is most unnatural. The third instance of the alleged unnatural conduct pointed out by the learned counsel was that the parents and brothers of the deceased did not lock the door of the bathroom in question from outside to prevent the appellant from escaping, for how would they know that the appellant would not try to break free. C The next submission advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant was that the case of the prosecution is marred by many improbabilities arising therein. The first improbability pointed out by the learned counsel was that as many as eight injuries were found on the person of the deceased as recorded in the post mortem report exhibitPW-9/1. According to the counsel, had the appellant inflicted eight injuries on the person of the deceased, the deceased would have cried or shrieked and the same would have attracted the attention of her parents and brothers. However, as per the prosecution, they did not even hear a whisper of cry of the deceased and that they came to know about the incident in question when they looked for the deceased when they Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 could not find her anywhere in the house. The second improbability pointed out by the counsel was that the weapon allegedly used by the appellant to murder the deceased was an ordinary kitchen knife. Counsel pointed out that the appellant could have picked up said knife only from the kitchen of the house. Counsel submitted that Vibhor PW- 19, deposed that when the deceased arrived in the room where he i.e. Vibhor was being taught by the appellant, he i.e. Vibhor went to the kitchen to drink water and that thereafter when he came back to the room he did not find the appellant there and noticed that the door of the bathroom attached to the room was locked. Counsel submitted that in such circumstances, Vibhor would have seen the appellant picking up from the kitchen the knife used to murder the deceased, which was not the position in the instant case. It was highlighted that it was just impossible for the appellant to have picked up the knife from the kitchen when Vibhor went to the kitchen and returned. It was submitted that the two i.e. the appellant and Vibhor would have crossed each other and Vibhor not so deposing means that the knife was never with the appellant. The third improbability pointed out by the learned counsel was that no tutor would teach a child at 09.30 P.M. in the night. Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 D The next submission advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant was that there are manifest errors in the impugned judgment. i The first error pointed out by the learned counsel was that the learned Trial Judge has committed a patent illegality in holding that the circumstance that the appellant failed to prove that Tinny Tinnu came to visit him in jail and that Tinny Tinnu handed over the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 to him leads to a conclusion that the accused is Tinny Tinnu and that the deceased had written the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 to the appellant. According to the counsel, the only conclusion which could have resulted from the said set of circumstances was that the appellant failed to prove the existence of Tinny Tinnu. In said regards, the learned counsel drew attention of the court to the fact that the parents and brothers of the deceased falsely denied that the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 do not contain the handwriting of the deceased. According to the counsel, had the appellant been Tinny Tinnu, the parents and brothers of the deceased would not have denied that the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 were written by the deceased for the said fact would have gone a long way in proving the guilt of the appellant. Counsel submitted that the fact that the parents and brothers of the deceased denied that the Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 were written by the deceased strongly suggests that the appellant was not Tinny Tinnu. Counsel then drew the attention of the court to the following recording contained in the letters exhibit exhibitDW-4/1-2 and exhibitDW-4/3-5 respectively a Varun shall tell you many things which would prove that I forgot you completely over there, that I am wrong you will beat me, scold me b I used to start crying just as I started sending you kisses. Mamiji saw those tears, the very first day According to the counsel, the aforesaid writings goes to show that Varun, the brother of the deceased, and the maternal aunt of the deceased knew about the affair between the deceased and Tinny Tinnu. Counsel submitted that had the appellant been Tinny Tinnu, the family of the deceased would have ended all their relations with the appellant the moment it came to their knowledge that the deceased is having an affair with the appellant. As a limb of the aforesaid submission, counsel further contended that the learned Trial Judge has committed an illegality in heavily relying upon the circumstance that the defence taken by the appellant was false, to infer the guilt of the accused. Counsel submitted that it is settled legal principle that the circumstance of a false defence taken by an accused is a circumstance which, after the chain of the circumstances appearing against an Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 accused is complete, can be added to the said chain to reinforce the guilt of the accused. In support of the said contention, the counsel relied upon the decision of Supreme Court reported as Sharad Birdhichand Sarda v State of Maharashtra AIR 1984 SC 1622. ii The second error pointed out by the learned counsel for the accused was that the learned Trial Court wrongly came to the conclusion that the appellant had a lust for the deceased, for there was no evidence on record which could support said conclusion. Learned counsel pointed out that none of the family members of the deceased deposed that the appellant had a lust for the deceased. On the contrary, Anil Garg PW-2 and Varun Garg PW-3, the father and brother of the deceased respectively, deposed that the appellant used to treat the deceased like his own daughter. 56. Keeping in view the defence taken by the appellant, in the instant case it would certainly be relevant whether the defence succeeds. The reason is obvious. The appellant has admitted his being arrested on being found inside the same bathroom in which the dead body of the deceased was found after the police reached the scene of the crime. Whereas the prosecution alleges that the appellant killed the deceased inside the bathroom and locked himself inside the Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 bathroom, the defence alleges that after the deceased was killed, the appellant was entrapped to come to the house and was pushed inside the bathroom and kept confined till the police arrived. 57. Suffice would it be to state that where a person is murdered at a spot and the accused is apprehended at the spot itself, the accused has to render an explanation as to how the deceased was killed and if not such explanation is rendered, the accused must admit the guilt. This is plain logic. The appellant has well understood the same and hence the defence of entrapment. 58. Thus, it can be safely be said that the instant case is akin to two trains running on parallel lines and the diversions for the destination being towards the fag end of the journey and hence a close look at the competing claims of the prosecution and the defence. Instant case is not of a kind where the defence is of alibi and hence the principle of law that irrespective of the proof of alibi, the prosecution has to prove its case of guilt beyond reasonable doubt being proved. 59. The most crucial aspect of the defence of the appellant is the mysterious Tinny Tinnu to whom the deceased has written numerous letters, proved to be in the hand of the deceased by the testimony of DW-4. Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 60. It is but apparent that the deceased was emotionally involved with somebody whom she referred to as Tinny and sometimes Tinnu. It is true that the parents of the deceased and her brother have denied the letters in question being written by the deceased, but the said denial has to be understood in the context of the traditional Indian society where premarital affair with a person of the opposite sex is considered as bad character and a dishonour to the reputation of the family. We read nothing more in the false denial by the family members of the deceased that the said letters were in the hand of the deceased. 61. Now, the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 could be with the appellant only under two circumstances. One, on being written and handed over by the deceased to the appellant or as claimed by the appellant when Tinny visited him in jail along with two friends Raj and Suresh. 62. As is to be noted from para 19 above, in his application filed under [SECTION] ., the appellant claimed that Tinny had met him in jail during visitors hours on a date between 21.4.1999 to 9.5.2000 and hence prayer was made to summon the jail record containing record of visits made by visitors to the jail inmates during said period. 63. It appears to be very innocent, but is rooted, in our opinion in a wicked mind, that the said application was filed Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 on 6.9.2005 when the appellant knew that the jail records have been weeded out. We say so for the reason in the letter exhibitDW-5/PB written by the appellant to the parents of the deceased he has posted of his crafty skills by writing that he has created enough confusion and he is making a prayer to summon the jail record knowingfully well that the same has been weeded out. 64. The fact that the appellant had these letters with him from the very beginning is evidenced by the fact that he confronted Anil Garg PW-2 with these letters on 8.5.2002. 65. The fact that nobody gave these letters to the appellant can be inferred from the fact that had they been so handed over to the appellant as claimed by him when Tinnu met him in the jail, the appellant would have immediately moved an application to preserve the jail record recording Tinnus visit to the jail. The appellant did not do so. We reiterate that the contents of the letter exhibitDW-5/PB written by the appellant to the parents of the deceased are a reflection of his crafty mind. His claim that he was compelled and forced to write the letters exhibitDW-5/PA and exhibitDW-5/PB is preposterous keeping in view the sublime language, richness of content and the phraseology of the two letters which no jail inmate can compel another to write. The literary and the intellectual skill of the appellant is Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 evidenced not only by the said two letters but even from the well penned written arguments filed by the appellant in Court in his own handwriting and the fact that those whom he taught as a private tutors got admissions in IITs and MBA Institutes of repute as claimed by the appellant himself. 66. Having held that the appellant failed to prove that a person named Tinny Tinnu met the appellant in jail and handed over the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17, the question which arises is how come letters written by the deceased to Tinny Tinnu came in possession of the appellant. 67. Was it that the appellant is none else but Tinny Tinnu 68. The name of the appellant is Uttam. Remove the letter U from Uttam and one is left with ttam. Lovingly, it is easy to transform Uttam to Tinny and Tinny to Tinnu. 69. The letters exhibitDW-5/PA and exhibitDW-5/PB written by the appellant to the family members of the deceased also provide a clue regarding the identity of Tinny Tinnu. 70. The letter exhibitDW-5/PA records that the mother of the deceased can collect letters written by the deceased, 50 in number, from the appellant. The appellant only produced 17 letters written by the deceased. What about the remaining Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 33 letters Why did the appellant withhold remaining 33 letters written by the deceased 71. The letter exhibitDW-5/PB written by the appellant to the parents of the deceased records that the deceased was the soul of the appellant. This is an expression used by lovers for each other. 72. Love songs and love letters are best comprehended only by the lovers. They carry scuttle messages and meanings. Code words and code language is used. The metaphors are intended to convey signals which only the opposite can receive and download. Unless assisted by linguistic and psychology experts it may be difficult for a Court to fathom the real meaning of such letters. But, what is relevant for us is the fact that the deceased has expressed not only her love for Tinny but even the anguish that she would never be able to be his. 73. In paras 23 to 27 above, we have noted extracts of some of the letters written by the deceased to Tinny Tinnu and they show that the deceased realized the mess in which she was. It shows that she was conscious of the fact that her relationship with Tinnu would just not be acceptable to anyone. 74. The young girl was a student of the IInd year undergoing her graduation course. As claimed by the Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 appellant and not denied by the family members of the young girl, the appellant had been her tutor for years together and thereafter for the younger siblings. The young girl was obviously besmitten by the intelligence of her tutor and so was the tutor. Whereas the young girl realized that she was helpless and hence allowed herself to be drifted, hoping that the currents would anchor her, the appellant acted coldly and with precision. 75. The post mortem of the deceased was conducted at about 11.35 A.M. on 20.04.1999 as recorded in the post mortem report exhibitPW-9/1 of the deceased. The post mortem report exhibitPW-9/1 records that the death of the deceased had taken place 12 hours prior to the conduct of post mortem. Therefore, as per the post mortem report, the deceased died at about 11.35 P.M. on 19.04.1999. It is a recognized fact that an error of plus or minus 2 hours could be taken in the instant case in fixing the time of death. In that view of the matter, it has to be taken that the deceased died any time between 09.35 P.M. on 19.04.1999 to 01.35 A.M. on 20.04.1999. 76. The daily diary entry exhibitPW-4/A shows a call made at the police station at 1120 in the night pertaining to the incident and thus we have empirical evidence wherefrom it can safely be said that the deceased was killed prior to Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 1120 PM. Thus, the probable time of death could be any time between 930 PM to 1120 PM. It was urged that as per Vibhor and the other family members the crime took place at 930 PM, which is the time recorded as that of occurrence even in the rukka. Thus, there is empirical evidence of the crime being committed at 930 PM. Submission made was that the family has taken 1 hour and 50 minutes time to inform the police and this means that something was being brewed. Obviously, the suggestion was that what was being brewed was whom to entrap. 77. Now, the family members have deposed that the deceased returned to her house with her mother after shopping at 930 PM. Thereafter, as deposed to by them, the various articles purchased during shopping were removed from the car and were kept inside a bedroom in the house. The shopping was not ordinary shopping and was not that of only one or two articles. The deceased was to get married shortly and the shopping was of her dowry articles. Nobody has spoken as to how many articles were purchased, but presumably they were many. Thus, time would be consumed to bring the purchases inside the bedroom. Nobody has said that the deceased immediately walked up to the room of Vibhor. Nobody has said that they looked at their watches to identify the time being 930 PM. It is Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 apparent that as is usually to be noted in most cases, the time 930 PM got fixed on rough estimates by all as time when the deceased returned home with the mother and not taking into account the time spent in removing the purchases from the car and bringing the same inside the bedroom and ignoring the fact that may be the deceased went after sometime to the room where Vibhor was taking tuition. Further, as deposed by the family members, when Vibhor and his father went to the room where Vibhor was taking tuition and saw neither appellant nor the deceased in the room, they thought that the appellant was in the bathroom and the deceased may have walked away. Only when the deceased was nowhere to be seen in the house and the appellant remained inside the bathroom, was the suspicion raised that something was amiss. Apparently, further time was consumed in this process, removing the said event further away from 930 PM. But, freezing the time at 930 PM, everybody started talking of the crime being committed at 930 PM. This got reflected even in the rukka dispatched from the house. 78. Thus, it would be useless to predicate an argument as if 930 PM was the time when the crime was detected. 79. Returning to the time when the deceased returned home with her mother at 930 PM, and the same being a Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 simple estimation, well, the time of return could well be around 945 PM. Giving time of 5 to 10 minutes to unload the purchases from the car and bring them inside and further 10-15 minutes time for the deceased and her mother to check that everything was brought inside and discounting sometime for the deceased to walk to the room where Vibhor was being taught by the appellant, discounting further time for Vibhor and his father searching for the deceased and then realizing that something was amiss in the appellant continuing to be in the toilet and then detecting as to what had happened, it is possible that by the time the crime was detected it was around 1045 or 1100 PM. 80. Thus, it is apparent that the crafty appellant is building a defence picking up a nut here and a bolt there. 81. If the defence of entrapment is considered, it would mean that the deceased was killed by her father and her brother out of anguish and frustration and having realized what they did, obviously an escape had to be found. The two and the remaining family members put their heads together to think a way out. Could the body be disposed of If yes, how If not, why If not, what to do Whose help can we take Can we bribe somebody to accept the guilt If yes, who Would not all such alternatives being discussed Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 require time We think it would. What would be the reasonable time Well, keeping in view that respectable persons had murdered their daughter, it would be troubled and puzzled minds minds under fear which would be thinking. These minds would have no focus, much less a logic. To arrive at a consensus, these troubled minds would not be expected to arrive at a solution within reasonable dispatch. 82. Now, assuming that these troubled minds arrived at a solution to falsely entrap somebody, it had to be further pondered over as to who should be ensnared. Various alternatives of ensnaring and the person to be ensnared had to be discussed. He had to be an easy target. Is it believable that these troubled minds would have contrived to design that let appellant be the victim. It is preposterous to so believe and accept. For this to have happened would mean that the family members of the deceased were cock sure that the appellant would be in his house and would immediately come on being summoned. What is the material before us that the family members were sure that the appellant was in his house and would immediately come on being summoned None. 83. As per the appellant and even as per the parents of the deceased, the appellant was a man of their confidence and Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 they believed that he treated their children as his own. It is difficult to believe that sharing such relationship of trust and confidence the family members of the deceased would strike a wicked plan to falsely entrap the appellant. 84. That leads us to another scenario. The police arrived in the house by around 1140 PM and admittedly the appellant was inside the bathroom with the dead body of the deceased inside. Though no witness has so stated and there is no evidence on record, but learned counsel for the appellant and the State informed us that the house where the appellant resided was at a distance of about 10 minutes drive from the house of the deceased. Thus, at least 20 minutes would be consumed to make a visit to and fro from the house of the deceased to that of the appellant and back. Given the fact that the appellant would have spent a minimum of minute or two in his house before embarking on his journey to reach the house of the deceased, on being summoned by her parents, about 22 minutes further time needs to be added while adding up the time to probablize what could have happened. That by 1120 PM information was passed on to the police means that the family members of the deceased had entrapped the appellant inside the bathroom in their house by 1120 PM and this means that the process of sending somebody to fetch the appellant had Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 commenced by around 1050 PM. Going backwards, the process to think about all the alternatives and rule out the worst and pick on the best needs to be over within less than 30 minutes and under the circumstances we hold the same to be most impractical and unreasonably less for a conspiracy of the magnitude to be hatched. 85. Was it not easy for the family members to entrap any servant in the house Why pick on the appellant 86. It is true that Insp.J.S.Gill PW-18 ought to have tried to ascertain as to what happened to the buttons on the shirt of the appellant which had broken. It would have been advisable to have searched for the buttons and picked them up. But, for a lapse committed by the investigating officer, it cannot be said that a case otherwise proved should be thrown out. 87. Insofar as the argument that the photographs exhibitPW- 12/12 and exhibitPW-12/13 show the door of the bathroom in question in an intact condition and hence the claim of the family members of the deceased and the police officers that the door was broken into is false and this probablizes that the door was never locked from inside relevant would it be to note that Anil Garg PW-2 and Const.Bhoora Singh PW-13 deposed that the bolt on the inner side of the door in question got broken when the police applied pressure to Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 break open the said door. Thus, the testimony of aforesaid witnesses clarifies the position that it was the bolt on the inner side of the door which got broken. As already noted herein above, there are two photographs of the door in question being exhibitPW-12/12 and exhibitPW-12/13. The photograph exhibitPW-12/13 shows the inner side of the door in question i.e. the position of the door when photographed while standing inside the bathroom, while the photograph exhibitPW-12/12 shows the outer side of the door in question i.e. photographed while standing inside the bedroom. Therefore, it is the photograph exhibitPW-12/12 which is relevant for the purposes of the present argument. The bolt is at the top of the door. A minute look at the photograph exhibitPW-12/12 shows that the bolt hole is present on the beading of the door. A bolt hole is affixed to the wooden frame on the side whereof the door is hinged. The photograph exhibitPW-12/12 shows the bolt hole on the inner side of the door in question in a dislodged condition. What appears to have happened is that when the door was pushed from outside the bolt hole gave way as the screws which had secured the same to the frame gave way and the bolt hole remained embracing the bolt and when the door was shut, along with the bolt, the bolt hole came back to the same position where it originally was, creating an elusion of it Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 being at the same place. Now, this could not have happened for the obvious reason where the bolt is moved upwards to secure it inside the bolt hole, it is only then that a door gets locked. If the bolt was secured inside the bolt hole on the door in the side of the bathroom, nobody could have entered inside as the door would not have opened. 88. We wonder as to what is the factual basis for the argument that there is mismatch at the place where the vest of the appellant which was seized when he was arrested got stained with blood vis a-vis the shirt. There is no material for us to discuss said argument and thus we reject the same as also the argument of planting. 89. Is the learned counsel for the appellant right in contending that the opinion exhibitPW-9/2 implies that only injuries Nos.1 and 2 found on the person of the deceased were caused by the knife recovered from his possession and that the remaining injuries found on the person of the deceased was caused by another weapon We do not think so. Since only injuries Nos.1 and 2 found on the person of the deceased were responsible for the death of the deceased, Dr.Komal Singh PW-9, thought it proper to give his opinion with respect to the weapon of offence only in respect of said two injuries. Realizing that the opinion exhibitPW- 9/2 does not give an opinion with respect to the weapon of Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 offence regarding all the injuries found on the person of the deceased, the investigating officer rightly thought it proper to obtain further opinion in respect of the remaining injuries on the person of the deceased. In that view of the matter, we find nothing suspicious in two opinions exhibitPW-9/2 and exhibitPW-9/3 being obtained from Dr.Komal Singh regarding the weapon of offence. 90. Regarding the argument that Dr.Komal Singh gave the opinion exhibitPW-9/3 without even looking at the knife recovered from the possession of the appellant, suffice would it be to note that Dr.Komal Singh penned the opinion exhibitPW-9/2 on the back page of the post mortem report exhibitPW-9/1 and he also drew the sketch of the knife in question on the said page. Dr.Komal Singh deposed that he perused the post mortem report while giving the opinion exhibitPW-9/3. It is thus apparent that Dr.Komal Singh gave the opinion exhibitPW-9/3 after examining the sketch of the knife in question. In that view of the matter, nothing turns upon the fact that Dr.Komal Singh did not look at the knife recovered from the possession of the appellant when rendering the opinion exhibitPW-9/3. 91. The argument that the sickle shaped injury found on the person of the deceased i.e. injury no.8 could not have been caused by the knife recovered from the possession of Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 the accused requires it to be noted that the knife in question, sketch whereof is exhibitPW-2/3, is a knife tapering towards the tip. Total length of the knife is 12.6 cm. The length of the blade is 7.6 cm. Therefore, the tapered portion of the knife could have caused the sickle shaped injury found on the person of the deceased. We find that Dr.Komal Singh was not given any suggestion that injury no.8 could not have possible been caused from the knife in question. 92. Regarding non joining of Satish Garg and his family members when the police came to the spot, suffice would it be to state that the father of the deceased deposed that Satish Garg was not present in the house at the time of the occurrence as he had gone to distribute the invitation cards for the marriage of the deceased. Thus, merely because Satish Garg resided on the ground floor of the same building is an irrelevant fact and cannot be used as a ground to urge that a material witness has been withheld. 93. That as many as six policemen accompanied Inspector J.S. Gill to the spot being used as an argument to urge that usually three police officers leave the police station when a crime is reported, it is important to note the contents of DD entry exhibitPW-4/1. As already noted herein above, DD entry exhibitPW-4/1 records that the father of the deceased informed that the appellant has locked the deceased in a bathroom Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 and that he is not opening the door inspite of repeated knocking at the door. Considering the fact that the deceased was locked in a bathroom by the appellant and thus he would require manpower to break open the door, Inspector J.S. Gill must have thought it proper to take more policemen with him to the spot. Therefore, there is nothing suspicious in the fact that six policemen accompanied the investigating officer to the said spot. 94. No question was put to Insp.J.S.Gill as to why he took six policemen along with him. Had one been asked, an answer would have come and then we would have found some scope for a debate, whether the answer was convincing. It is settled law that without questioning a witness on a point of controversy and eliciting a response, no argument can be built on said controversy by hinging the controversy on surmises and conjectures. 95. The submission that it was unnatural conduct for the family members of the deceased to not break the door of the bathroom when they knew that the appellant was inside the bathroom with the deceased, though attractive at first blush, ignores that as deposed to by the family members, the appellant had told them from inside that he had killed their daughter and thus, overcome by grief, fear and anxiety they could think of no better than to inform and summon the Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 police and do no more. We do not think that so unnatural is the conduct that it renders the family members without any merit of credit. The argument that this fact does not find mention in the DD entry exhibitPW-4/A, it is sufficient to note that DD entries are always cryptic and not descriptive. 96. The argument that it was highly improbable that the parents and the brothers of the deceased did not hear even a whisper of cry of the deceased when the appellant assaulted her ignores the possibility of the appellant taking the deceased by complete surprise and inflicting injuries Nos.1 and 2 on her person before she could react and by said time she was rendered speechless. Being a male, the appellant could have muffled her voice with his hand placed on her mouth. 97. Do we not come across cases day after day where brutal crimes are committed with victims beaten to pulp and yet nobody in the vicinity has heard their cries We have. It is also not unknown for victims to be rendered speechless when suddenly placed in a hostile situation. 98. The argument that the appellant could not have picked up the knife used by him for murdering the deceased from the kitchen of the house of the deceased without Vibhor noticing the same is premised on the assumption that the knife was picked up from the kitchen. No suggestion has Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 been given by the appellant to any family member that the knife belonged to them or was in the kitchen. It is possible that the appellant took the knife with him hoping to get an opportunity to do what he did. It is possible that the knife was already in the bedroom. It is a kitchen knife no doubt. Such kinds of knives are placed in the dining room and are sometimes carried inside the bedroom to cut or peel fruit. Thus, the argument anchors itself nowhere. 99. The argument that nobody takes tuition at 930 PM is neither here nor there for the reason Vibhor the person who claims as being taught by the appellant has not even been given a suggestion that he has falsely deposed that the appellant was imparting tuition to him at 930 PM when his sister and mother returned after shopping from the market. Thus it stands established that the appellant was already in the house at 930 PM. If this be so, the version of false entrapment falls flat. 100. The argument predicated on the denial by the family members of the deceased that the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 were not in the handwriting of the deceased, denials which were proved to be false through the testimony of DW-4, takes the case of the appellant not an inch forward for the reason in a conservative Indian society, as already opined by us hereinbefore, an affair with the opposite sex is Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 considered by some families as unchaste behaviour it is thought to be shame upon the family and hence the desire to suppress the truth. It is obvious that the family members of the deceased were saving their perceived family honour. 101. Do the contents of the letters exhibitDW-4/1-2 and exhibitDW- 4/3-5 show that the brother of the deceased i.e. Varun and the maternal aunt of the deceased were aware of the fact that the deceased was having an affair with the accused 102. The argument was advanced to bring home what We do not understand. 103. Had they known so, the fact that the appellant is a married person and was more than twice the age of the deceased would have immediately led the family members of the deceased to declare the appellant a persona non grata in their house, which they did not do. It is obvious that neither Varun nor his aunt know anything about the liking which the appellant had for the deceased and vice versa. 104. We have already commented hereinabove the intricacies involved in understanding the subtle undercurrents in love letters and especially when the writer has to hide his her true feelings. Save and except to gather that the writer of the letters i.e. the deceased was torn apart Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 as a result of her love for the addressee the appellant of the letters, we can read no further except that the deceased realized that her brother Varun and her maternal aunt had sensed out something amiss in the joy of life of the deceased but what that was has not surfaced. Surely not the fact that Varun and his aunt knew about the relationship between the appellant and the deceased. 105. The fact that the parents of the deceased have deposed that the appellant used to treat the deceased as their daughter shows that they believed that as a teacher the appellant was as good as a parent to their child. This itself establishes the fact that nobody suspected anything and it is a case of a crafty man warming and worming into the heart of a young girl and emotionally and may be physically exploiting her. 106. The testimony of the parents Anil Garg PW-2 and Uma Garg PW-10, and the brothers Varun Garg PW-3 and Vibhor Garg PW-19 of the deceased, as also the police officers who participated in the spot investigation namely Const.Bhura Singh PW-13, Const.Giri Kumar PW-14, Const.Mukesh PW-15 and SI Mukesh Kumar PW-17 and Inspector Jeewan Singh Gill PW-18 establishes that the appellant was found standing in the bathroom which was locked from inside and where Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 the deceased was found dead and that he was holding a knife in his hand at that time. The aforesaid witnesses were cross examined in extenso by the defence but nothing could be brought out which could cast a blemish on their evidence. 107. There is yet another significant fact which needs to be noted. As already stated herein above, save and except giving suggestion to Vibhor that the appellant used to impart tuitions to him between 5.00 P.M. to 6.00 P.M. and general suggestions pertaining to false implication of the appellant Vibhor was not cross examined with respect to essential portion of his testimony. Thus, the essential portion of the testimony of Vibhor has virtually gone unrebutted. 108. In the decision reported as M s. Chuni Lal Dwarka Nath Vs. Hartford Fire Insurance Co. Ltd. Anr. AIR 1958 Punjab 440 it was observed as under It is a well established rule of evidence that a party should put to each of his opponents witnesses so much of his case as concerns that particular witness. If no such questions are put, the Courts presume that the witness account has been accepted. If it is intended to suggest that a witness was not speaking the truth upon a particular point, his attention must first he directed to the fact by cross Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 examination so that he may have an opportunity of giving an explanation. In Browne v. Dunn, 1893 6 R 67 A, Lord Herschell observed 109. From the above conspectus of facts, the only conclusion which results is that the appellant is the murderer of the deceased. 110. It assumes some significance to note that the letter exhibitDW-5/PB written by the appellant to the parents of the Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 deceased has traces of admission of guilt, but we do not use the same as an extra judicial confession for lack of clarity of admission in unequivocal terms thereof. 111. We conclude by recording that the written submissions filed by the appellant in his own handwriting and the letters written by him to the parents of the deceased show a very crafty and a very fertile mind. The intelligence quotients of the appellant is of the highest order and as indeed bragged by him in one of his letter he has given a run for the money to a seasoned criminal lawyer of the stature of Shri R.N.Mittal, Senior Advocate who was appointed as a Special Public Prosecutor in the instant case. It is apparent that the appellant has near successfully built a defence around the lapses committed by the prosecution on two points, firstly in not searching for the three buttons which were broken from the shirt of the appellant and secondly the investigating officer not seizing the bolt hole with the screws coming loose when the door of the bathroom was pushed open. It is obvious that entry into the bathroom could not be effected without the door being opened and this was possible in the instant case when due to the push the bolt hole came off from the door frame as the screws gave way when pressure was applied on the door. It was common sense for the Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 investigating officer to have seized the bolt hole and the screws. But, with pain and anguish we must write that in 4 out of 10 cases we are seeing errors of stupidity committed by the investigating officers which have to be overlooked as aberrations by us for the reason it is the duty of the Court to balance public interest in the administration of justice requiring the exception to be applied to the exclusionary rule of excluding from consideration the investigation which is otherwise without taint. Indeed, it is time for the police to think and find an answer as to why in 4 out of 10 movies in India where there is some role of a policeman in the theme, the policeman is shown as a BUFFFON. 112. We dismiss Crl.Appeal no.433/2007 filed by the appellant Uttam Kumar. 113. As regards the Cross Appeal filed by the State, noting that the prayer made therein is to enhance the sentence, noting that the learned Trial Judge has himself directed that the appellant shall undergo imprisonment for life and while exercising the power to commute or remit the sentence the decision of the learned Judge, which brings out in the very first paragraph the evilness and depravity in the crime, would be placed before the Executive, meaning thereby the appellant would not earn his freedom on completing 14 Crl.A.no.433/2007 747/2007 years imprisonment, we feel that no case is made out to enhance the sentence by awarding death penalty. 114. Thus, Cross Appeal filed by the State is also dismissed. 115. Both appeals are dismissed. 116. Since the appellant Uttam Kumar is in jail we direct that a copy of this decision be sent to the Superintendent, Central Jail Tihar to be supplied to the appellant.
