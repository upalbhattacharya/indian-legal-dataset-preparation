      " [CARDINAL]. The writ petition was filed in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] when the petitioner was not considered for appointment to the post of Financial Advisor and Chief Accounts Officer of the respondent no.1 and when the respondent [ORG] was appointed to the said post. The writ petition was filed claiming the W.P.C [DATE] relief of striking down quashing and setting aside of the appointment of the respondent [ORG] and for declaration that the petitioner was eligible to be considered for appointment to the said post. Though the writ petition was accompanied with an application for interim relief but no interim relief was granted and the application for interim relief was ordered to be taken up along with the writ petition only. [CARDINAL]. The method of recruitment for the post of Financial Advisor and Chief Accounts Officer as per [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] is by promotion from departmental candidates, failing which by deputation from organizations of Government Public sector and failing which by direct recruitment. [CARDINAL]. The counsel for the petitioner has argued that thus the first attempt ought to have been by filling up the post by promotion only if the same was not possible, by filling up the post by deputation as aforesaid and only if no candidate fulfilled the qualification for the same also the appointment could be made by direct recruitment. [CARDINAL]. The respondent [ORG] was appointed by direct recruitment. [CARDINAL]. The challenge by the petitioner, who was already a departmental candidate, having been employed with the respondent no.1 since [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and who had sought appointment to the said post either by promotion and upon being not considered eligible for appointment by promotion, by direct recruitment, is twofold. He contends that he has been wrongly W.P.C [DATE] denied promotion. Alternatively, it is contended that he has been wrongly not considered for appointment by direct recruitment. [CARDINAL]. As far as the claim of the petitioner for appointment by promotion is concerned, under [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], the eligibility for the departmental candidates to be so promoted was, either [DATE] [DATE] service in the respondent [ORG] as Manager Finance and [NORP] or [DATE] [DATE] service in the respondent [ORG] as Joint Manager Finance Accounts. It is the admitted position that the petitioner was promoted as a Joint Manager Finance Accounts only in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Thus at the time when the applications for the said post were invited in or [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], the petitioner did not fulfill the criteria of [DATE] [DATE] service as Joint Manager Finance Accounts. [CARDINAL]. The contention of the petitioner however is that he was entitled to be promoted as Joint Manager Finance and Accounts as far back as in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and was wrongly denied the said promotion seniority and if had been granted the said seniority promotion in [DATE], he in [DATE] would have fulfilled the criteria of [DATE] [DATE] service as Joint Manager Finance Accounts. On enquiry, the counsel for the petitioner points out to prayer paragraph ii of the writ petition where the relief for granting due seniority to the petitioner is also claimed. It has at the outset been enquired from the counsel for the petitioner as to whether the claim of the petitioner in this petition filed in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] for seniority from as far back as in W.P.C [DATE] [DATE] was not barred by laches, waiver and acquiescence. Objection in this regard has also been taken by the respondent no.1 in the counter affidavit. However, it is found that the claim of the petitioner for the said seniority is based on the judgment dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] of the Division Bench of this [ORG] in [GPE] [PERSON] [PERSON]. Trade Fair Authority of [GPE] being the predecessor in interest of the respondent [ORG]. Since the claim for seniority is based solely on the judgment of [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], the same is not found to be so belated as to be denied for the reason of laches, acquiescence and waiver. As such the counsel for the petitioner has been heard on the merits of the said claim. [CARDINAL]. A perusal of the judgment in [GPE] [GPE] supra, though relating to the general cadre the petitioner herein belongs to the accounts cadre, shows that the minimum qualification for promotion to the post of Deputy Manager from the post of Assistant Manager is described as [DATE] [DATE] service as Assistant Manager. The case of the petitioner herein is that he joined the respondent [ORG] as Accounts Officer on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] that in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] he applied for and was directly recruited as Assistant Manager and in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] was promoted as Deputy Manager. [CARDINAL]. It has as such been enquired from the counsel for the petitioner as to what was the minimum qualification for promotion from the post of Deputy Manager to the post of Joint Manager to which the petitioner was ultimately promoted in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and with respect to which the W.P.C [DATE] petitioner claims to be entitled to be promoted in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. [CARDINAL]. It appears that when the minimum qualification for promotion to the post of Deputy Manager was [DATE] [DATE] service as [PERSON] [PERSON], there must be some such qualification for promotion as [ORG] Manager also. [CARDINAL]. The counsel for the petitioner has fairly admitted that there is nothing on the record in this regard. Under instructions from the petitioner present in [ORG] he states that the minimum qualification for promotion as [PERSON] [PERSON] was also [DATE] [DATE] service as Deputy Manager. It has then been enquired as to how the petitioner can claim to be entitled to be promoted as Joint Manager in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] when he had by then admittedly not completed [DATE] [DATE] as Deputy Manager. [CARDINAL]. It is pointed out that the petitioner in the present petition is claiming that he was entitled to be promoted as Deputy Manager in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] in accordance with the judgment in [GPE] [GPE] case. It has then been enquired from the counsel as to how the petitioner could make such claim without the minimum qualification of [DATE] [DATE] service as [PERSON] [PERSON], as recorded in the judgment in [GPE] [GPE]. The counsel replies that the respondent [ORG] has not been following the Rule of minimum qualification and has been relaxing the same for consideration for promotion. Attention in this regard is invited to para 2vii of the petition where it is pleaded that the respondent [ORG] had promoted [CARDINAL] department W.P.C [DATE] candidates who did not have the minimum qualification. [CARDINAL]. A reference to the corresponding paragraph of the counter affidavit shows that the respondent [ORG] therein has denied the said allegations as vague and incapable of eliciting any reply. Thus no reliance whatsoever can be placed on the averment in the petition of others without minimum qualification having been promoted. There is nothing else on record to show that the rule of minimum qualification was being relaxed. [CARDINAL]. Faced with the aforesaid, the counsel for the petitioner has fairly stated that he is not pressing his claim on the basis of promotion but on the basis of wrong denial for consideration as a direct recruit. [CARDINAL]. The qualification for direct recruitment was associate membership of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and [DATE] [DATE] managerial experience in Finance Accounts in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] reputed [ORG] [ORG] organizations, preferably in the field of exhibitions. It was further provided that out of [DATE] [DATE] at least five years experience should have been as Head of the [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. As far as the claim of the petitioner for consideration for appointment as direct recruit is concerned, the respondent no.1 in its counter affidavit in para no.2xiii has extracted the portion of the application of the petitioner for direct recruitment, where the petitioner W.P.C [DATE] himself had admitted that though he did not fulfill the requirement of [DATE] [DATE] as Head of the [ORG], but had sought direct recruitment in case a suitable candidate fulfilling all the conditions advertised was not available. [CARDINAL]. The argument also of the counsel for the petitioner is not that the petitioner fulfills the minimum requirements for direct recruitment but is that so did the respondent [CARDINAL] not fulfill the said requirement and if the respondent [ORG] has relaxed the same for the respondent [ORG], there was no reason for the respondent no.1 to have not relaxed the same for the petitioner also and ought to have considered the petitioner for direct recruitment. [CARDINAL]. The challenge to the respondent [ORG] not fulfilling the qualification for direct recruitment is twofold. [ORDINAL], it is contended that he did not have [DATE] [DATE] experience as Head of the [ORG] and [ORDINAL] that he did not have even 15 years managerial experience as required. [CARDINAL]. With respect to the [ORDINAL] challenge, it is stated that the respondent [ORG] as per his own documents, on the date of the application had managerial experience only of [DATE] [DATE] and [DATE] [DATE] instead of [DATE] [DATE] and out of that also [DATE] [DATE] was as a trainee. With respect to the [ORDINAL] challenge, attention is invited to the affidavit dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] filed by the respondent [ORG] in these proceedings where he has stated that he headed [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of his earlier employer namely [ORG] [ORG] 1762/1994 Corporation Ltd. and reported directly to [ORG]. It is informed that this [ORG] had issued notice to [ORG] and in response whereto [ORG] had issued a letter dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] at page [CARDINAL] of the paper book in which it had informed that [ORG] [ORG] is a separate entity and independent of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and that the petitioner as the Chief Manager of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] was reporting to the Director, Finance Administration. It is argued that when the Recruitment Rules required [DATE] [DATE] experience as Head of the [ORG], it required [DATE] [DATE] experience as Head of the entire [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and not merely of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] which is but [CARDINAL] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. It is urged that owing to the use of the words out of [DATE] [DATE] at least 5 years experience., [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] have to be read as Head of Finance Accounts and can not be as Head of Internal Audit. The counsel for the petitioner has also drawn attention to the Circular of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] to demonstrate that [ORG] [ORG] is a [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. It has been enquired from the counsel for the petitioner as to whether the petitioner has pleaded that he had also headed for [DATE] [DATE] any [ORG]. Though it is admitted that there are no pleadings to the said effect in the writ petition but attention is invited to the rejoinder filed by the petitioner to the additional affidavit of the respondent no.1 in which the petitioner has pleaded that [ORG] [ORG] is just one of the numerous functions and responsibilities of Head of Finance Accounts and the respondent [ORG] could not be considered as W.P.C 1762/1994 having requisite experience of [DATE] [DATE] as Head of Finance Accounts. In the said affidavit it is also pleaded that the petitioner has headed all the Divisions in the Finance Accounts Department of the respondent [ORG] including [ORG] [ORG] and should on the said parity have been considered as having experience of Head of Finance Accounts Department. [CARDINAL]. I have further enquired whether there is any document on record to show that the petitioner was Head of any of the Divisions of the Finance Accounts Department. I am informed that there is none. [CARDINAL]. I am unable to accept the contention that [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] experience as Head was required to be as Head of Finance Accounts. While the Recruitment Rules required [DATE] [DATE] managerial experience in Finance Accounts, the requirement as Head was only of a [ORG]. A literal reading of the said [ORG] [ORG] means that the [ORG] had to be a [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. While in relation to [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], the word [ORG] is not used, while providing for experience as Head, the word [ORG] has been used and which can only mean [CARDINAL] of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. If the intent had been that [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] experience should be as Head of the Finance Accounts, there was no need to carve out difference [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] as aforesaid. [CARDINAL]. The respondent no.1 else in its counter affidavit has pleaded that [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] was satisfied qua [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] experience of the respondent [PRODUCT] as Head of the [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. The counsel for the petitioner has next invited attention to the document at page [CARDINAL] of the paper book being photocopy of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] to contend that the respondent [ORG] did not spent [DATE] [DATE] as Head in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] also, as claimed by him. However no opportunity was granted to either of the respondents to respond to the affidavit of the petitioner to which the said document was annexed and hence no reliance at this stage can be placed thereon. Of course, the counsel for the petitioner has stated that the matter be adjourned to enable the petitioner to produce further documents and to call for the response of the respondents to the said documents but now when the arguments have been heard and when the pleadings stood completed way back in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and the matter has been pending since then, it is not deemed expedient to adjourn the hearing. The parties were fully aware of their respective cases and in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] ought to have made up the deficiencies, if any and after the hearing, they can not seek adjournment of the matter. [CARDINAL]. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of the respondent [ORG] having found considered the respondent [ORG] to be satisfying the criteria and nothing having been brought before the [ORG] to show that the decision of W.P.C [DATE] the said [ORG] [ORG] is perverse or based on no material at all, this [ORG] can not sit in appeal over the decision of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. It was at the outset of the hearing enquired from the counsel for the petitioner as to what is the status [DATE] of the petitioner and the respondent [ORG]. It is informed that the petitioner was promoted as Financial Adviser and Chief Account Officer in [DATE] and is now about to retire in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. It is informed that the respondent [ORG] is now working as Senior General Manager, [ORG] [ORG] and has [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] of service left. The counsel has with reference to [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON]. S.D. Majumdar AIR 2007 [CARDINAL] 2102 para [CARDINAL] contended that if this Court were to held that the petitioner was wrongfully not considered for appointment in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] through direct recruitment, a notional DPC ought to be directed and the case of the petitioner for appointment be directed to be considered and if the petitioner is selected, he would be entitled to all benefits of such appointment. [CARDINAL]. I have not been able to find that the petitioner who was admittedly not eligible for direct appointment has been discriminated against qua the respondent [ORG]. While there was enough material before [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] to find that the respondent [ORG] had the requisite managerial experience including [DATE] [DATE] experience as Head of the [ORG], the petitioner at the contemporaneous time did not even claim to be eligible. Even otherwise, there can be no negative discrimination in law. [CARDINAL]. No case even otherwise now after [DATE] [DATE] for granting the relief of quashing the appointment of the respondent [ORG], when petitioner was admittedly not eligible, is made out. The petitioner is therefore not found entitled to any relief. [CARDINAL]. The counsel for the petitioner at this stage states that the petitioner be granted liberty to approach the respondent no.1 for fixation of his seniority. [CARDINAL]. Since the case of the petitioner for fixation of seniority has not been pressed in this [ORG] owing to the material therefor having not been placed before this [ORG], liberty is so granted to the petitioner. The writ petition is dismissed with no order as to costs and with liberty aforesaid to the petitioner. RAJIV [ORG] ENDLAW JUDGE [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] gsr bb W.P.C [DATE]\n",
      "========================================\n",
      " [CARDINAL]. The appellant herein got registration of trademark [ORG] under [PERSON] dated [DATE] in Class- 5 questioning this registration in favour of the appellant, the respondent herein filed application for removal of the aforesaid trademark [ORG] or rectification of register under[ SECTION_UNK], [DATE], [DATE], [DATE] and [CARDINAL] of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW], [DATE] hereinafter referred to as the Act. To put it in brief, the removal was sought on the ground that the said trademark [ORG] was deceptively similar to an earlier registered trademark, viz., ORZID label mark, standing registered in the name of the respondent no.1 in Class- 5. The plea of the respondent herein was accepted by [ORG] no.679 of [DATE] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] for brevity vide decision dated [CARDINAL]. The [ORG] allowed the rectification application with direction to the Registrar of the [NORP] to remove the trademark [ORG] belonging to the appellant from the register. The appellant field [FAC] [FAC] challenging the said order of the [ORG] which has been dismissed by the learned Single Judge vide orders dated 04.7.2011 thereby affirming the order of the [ORG]. The appellant filed the instant intra [ORG] appeal questioning the validity of the said order of the learned Single Judge. [CARDINAL]. When this appeal came up for hearing on [ORG], counsel for the appellant had inter alia urged that the respondent has filed the rectification application without leave being obtained under[ SECTION_UNK]ii of the Trademarks Act, [DATE] from [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and therefore, rectification application before the [ORG] was not maintainable. It was noted by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] that this plea urged by the appellant had not been dealt with by the learned Single Judge. It was not known as to whether the same was even pressed or not, liberty was granted to the appellant to move an application before the learned Single Judge in this behalf. The application was accordingly moved before the learned Single Judge. This application has also been dismissed vide orders dated 09.9.2011. Thereafter, leave was given to include challenge to this order as well. It is in this backdrop we are called upon the deal with the orders dated 04.7.2011 passed in the writ petition and orders dated 09.9.2011 passed in [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART]. Arguments were heard on these aspect, which are submitted vide written submissions of the parties as well. [CARDINAL]. In the application for rectification filed by the respondent before the [ORG], it was claimed that the respondent was the manufacturer and marketer of various pharmaceutical products under a large number of trademarks. The company which had a modest [CARDINAL] Crores of infrastructure in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] has grown at a remarkable pace to achieve a capital base of [CARDINAL] Crores has achieved a turnover of [LAW] [LAW] and a world leadership in the pharmaceutical bulk actives in a short period of time. The respondent also claims to have [CARDINAL] modern state of art manufacturing plants and a one of its kind R D centre. It was awarded the prestigious [ORG] [ORG], [ORG] [ORG] and OHSAS 18001 certificates for its world class quality management, environmental management and occupational health and safety management system. It was also claimed by the respondent that it is the pioneer in establishing [CARDINAL] discharge facilities in the [NORP] pharmaceutical industry. In [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], it adopted the trademark ORZID which is used with respect to the appellants pharmaceutical preparations having active ingredient CEFTAZIDINE and the said mark became popular among the medical fraternity. On 06.9.1999, the appellant filed application [ORG] for registration of trade mark ORZID with respect to medical and pharmaceutical preparations. This application was advertised in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] no.1291 S dated [DATE] and got registration of the mark unopposed. The appellant commenced use of the trademark upon goods with effect from [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. It was, thus, claimed that being prior user and prior registered proprietor, the use by any person, an identical or any other mark deceptively similar thereto would amount to infringement of the appellants registered trademark. As per the [ORG] no.679 of [DATE] respondent, it came to know about the trademark [ORG] of the appellant in respect of medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] which according to the respondent was slavish imitation of the respondent registered trademark. The respondent [ORG], thus, filed a civil suit in [GPE] no.1027 2007 in the High Court of Madras seeking permanent injunction restraining the appellant to use that trademark which amounted to infringement of registered trade mark and from passing off its goods as that of respondent. Ex parte injunction was granted on [DATE]. However thereafter, this the respondent filed [GPE] no.187 of 2008 seeking interim injunction against passing off. While this application was pending adjudication, the respondent also filed the aforesaid application for rectification before the [ORG]. In the reply filed by the appellant to the said application, the appellant also claimed to be part of the famous [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and is one of the fastest growing companies in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], incorporated under [LAW] [LAW] [LAW], [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and had established a great reputation by adopting latest manufacturing techniques introducing world class quality products, ground braking R D efforts in association with its foreign counterparts and for setting new standards of customer service. [CARDINAL]. The plea of the appellant regarding trademark [ORG] was that this trademark was adopted in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and the registration of trademark for its pharmaceutical preparations and obtained registration of the trademark unopposed under [PERSON] dated [DATE]. It was stated that the appellant is continuously and extensively using the same and in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], the sale of goods under this trademark was [ORG] no.679 of [DATE] [DATE] lacs. According to the appellant, the trademark [ORG] is an invented word coined by the appellant. The mark is adopted from the words FORceftaZIDime, where the suffix [ORG] was adopted from the word [ORG], which is the medicinal ingredients of the drug and thus and such an adoption ought to have been also protected under[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act. Furthermore, several manufacturers of Ceftazidime injections were using trademarks with the suffix [ORG], such as [ORG], [ORG], [ORG], [ORG], [ORG], [ORG], [ORG], [ORG], etc. Moreover, the appellants product [ORG] injection is a Schedule H drug, which can be sold only on the written prescription of a registered medical practitioner. The appellants product [ORG] is always prescribed by a doctor based on the ailments suffered by a patient and is dispensed with by a qualified druggist and chemist. This fact was also wrongly not considered in favour of the appellant. [CARDINAL]. The appellant had also narrated about the orders passed by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] whereby ex parte stay was granted in favour of the respondent was vacated by way of speaking order and the appeal against that order was also dismissed by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and the plea of delay was taken up. [CARDINAL]. The [ORG] was, however, not convinced with the defence put by the appellant herein. It held that the trademark [ORG] was deceptible similar to the earlier trademark ORZID in respect of some pharmaceutical products. Position in law was stated, viz., a trademark can not be registered if it is of such nature as to deceive the public or cause confusion or it is similar with an earlier trade mark and goods covered by the trademark are [ORG] no.679 of [DATE] similar, the [ORG] quoted from the judgment of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in Amritdhara Pharmacy Vs. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON], AIR 1963 SC 449 and [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], [DATE] [DATE] [ORG] [FAC] SC and on the application of principles in those judgments, position in the instant case was analysed in the following manner [CARDINAL]. It was also held that the appellant adopted the trademark [ORG] with dishonest and mala fide intention and had even set up a false claim of user date. The [ORG] also rejected the plea on delay, laches and acquiescence. Discussion on these aspects is as under 8. Consequently, the rectification application was allowed. [CARDINAL]. Before the learned Single Judge, arguments were substantially the same. The learned Single Judge first took up the issue of deceptive similarity between the [CARDINAL] competing marks [ORG] and ORZID. According to the learned Single Judge, no doubt, the word [ORG] which was common to both [ORG] and ORZID was derived from active pharmaceutical ingredient [ORG]. However, while comparing the [CARDINAL] trademarks as a whole, it was clear that [ORG] is nothing but ORZID prefixed by a soft consonant F. This meant prefixing of the letter [PRODUCT] failed to distinguish [ORG] sufficiently from ORZID so as not to cause deception or confusion in the mind of an average customer holding that the [CARDINAL] competing marks were to be compared as a whole which was the rule of dissection of mark is an exception which is not generally permitted, in the present case, [ORG] applied a correct test. The learned Single Judge also discussed in detail the principle of law laid down in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] supra case, viz., more regress test in deciding the matters relating to pharmaceuticals with preparations and observed as under 10. Following dicta from the judgment of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and Others Vs. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] SCC 545 also brings home the point candidly 11.[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act becomes significant in the process. It uses the expression earlier trademark and not earlier registered trademark. As per[ SECTION_UNK] z b of the Act, therefore, phonetic similarity could be compared while examining the case of the confusion. It is for this reason, we [ORG] no.679 of [DATE] have earlier observed that the arguments proceed on wrong premise. [CARDINAL]. Brushing aside the arguments of the learned counsel for the appellant that the respondent could not have successfully asked for rectification, as respondents registration was only for a label mark, the learned Single Judge observed that the judgment by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in the case of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] Vs. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON], AIR 2006 SC 3304 was a complete answer to this argument. The learned Single Judge also rejected the contention of the appellant that in view of orders of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] vacating the interim injunction, [ORG] has passed the impugned order on the principles of comity of jurisdiction, observed that in forming an opinion at the time of deciding interim injunction only prima facie conclusion is arrived at. [CARDINAL]. Dismissing the application for modification preferred by the appellant, vide orders dated [ORG], the learned Single Judge, in the [ORDINAL] instance, clarified that the plea of prior permission of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of Madras High Court was not pressed when the writ petition was finally heard. However, counsel for the appellant had necessitated that this plea be taken on merits as it goes to the root of the matter. It was noted by the learned Single Judge that when the application for interim injunction was dismissed and ex parte stay vacated by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] as far as infringement of trademark ORZID, the appellant thereafter filed application to restrain the appellant from passing off its pharmaceutical preparation using the trade mark [ORG]. This application as dismissed by the learned Single Judge on 30.4.2008. Prior thereto on 11.3.2008, the respondent filed a rectification application [ORG] no.679 of [DATE] before the [ORG]. Consequently, when the respondent filed appeal before [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], the rectification application was already pending before the [ORG]. The appellant, at this stage, could not point out to the Division Bench that the rectification application could not have been filed by the respondent before the [ORG] to dispose of the rectification application on or before 16.10.2008. From this, the learned Single Judge has drawn the inference with the appellant accepted the maintainability of respondents rectification application before the [ORG] and in any case, the aforesaid order of the Division Bench amounted to imply permission for the purposes of[ SECTION_UNK] 1bii of the Act. That was a reason, this point was not urged by the [ORG] or even before the learned Single Judge in the [ORDINAL] instance. Another reason given by the learned Single judge is as under Re Maintainability of Rectification Petition without obtaining specific permission of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] under[ SECTION_UNK]b of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW].[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act reads as [DATE] [DATE]. This provision deals with stay of proceedings in civil suit where validity of registration of trademark is questioned. However, proceedings for rectification in this behalf are pending before the [PRODUCT] or the [ORG], the [ORG] trying the suit shall stay the suit pending final proceedings. If no such proceedings are pending and the [ORG] is satisfied that plea regarding the invalidity of the registration of the plaintiffs or defendants trademark is prima facie tenable, the [ORG] has to [ORDINAL] to frame the issue and adjourn the case for [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] from the date of the framing of the issue in order to enable the party to apply to [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] for rectification of the register. Under sub [LAW] [LAW] of[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act, stay of the suit can be extended until the final disposal of the rectification proceedings. Interpreting this provision, a learned Single Judge of this Court in the case of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. Vs. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], [DATE] [DATE] PTC 733 Del. held that application for rectification could not be filed without showing and obtaining prima facie satisfaction of the [ORG] about their plea of the invalidity of the registration of the mark. The discussion in this behalf is in Paras [CARDINAL] to 32. We may reproduce [PERSON] [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL] for out benefit. These paras are as [DATE] [DATE]. We may also record that [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in the case of [FAC] [FAC] [FAC] [FAC] Vs. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], [DATE] PTC [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] has taken the same view. Even the aforesaid view has been upheld by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of this [ORG] and the judgment is reported as [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and [ORG]. Vs. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] 2007 [CARDINAL] PTC [CARDINAL]. [CARDINAL]. Thus, insofar as this [ORG] is concerned, it has taken the view that the permission under[ SECTION_UNK] b of the Act is mandatory and if the proceedings are filed without obtaining such a permission, those would not be maintainable. [CARDINAL]. The situation as hand, of course, is not that simple. The matter has been complicated because of the reason that the Division Bench of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] has taken contrary vie in the case of [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON]. Prabha Singh LPA no.679 of [DATE] Jaswant Singh, rep. by its Power of Attorney Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON] and [ORG]., MIPR 2007 [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] holding that neither any such leave of the [ORG] was required nor the [ORG] is to frame issue and record prima facie satisfaction thereupon, before filing application for rectification. Raison dter for holding this view is explained by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in the following words [CARDINAL]. In normal circumstances, the answer to be given was simple, viz., this Division Bench is bound by the view taken by the coordinate [PERSON] of this [ORG] and not [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. However, the matter becomes complicated because of the reason that the respondent has filed a suit in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. Had the respondent approached [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] for framing of the issue, recording prima facie view and seeking permission, having regard its own judgment in the aforesaid case, the [ORG] would have said that no such permission is required. On the other hand, the appellant argues that since circuit [PERSON] of [ORG] in [GPE] dealt with the rectification application, due compliance of[ SECTION_UNK]b was mandatory, as this [PERSON] would be bound by the decision of this Court in Astrazeneca UK ltd. And [ORG] supra. Learned counsel for the appellant also referred to the reasoned judgment of [ORG] with the Circuit Bench sitting in [GPE] in the case of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] Vs. [ORG] [ORG] no.679 of [DATE] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], [DATE] [DATE] PTC 93 [ORG] where the [ORG] followed the decision of this Court in Astrazeneca UK ltd. And [ORG] supra. [CARDINAL]. Taking into consideration the position mentioned in the preceding paragraph, even when we proceed on the basis that [ORG] was bound to follow the [ORG] [ORG] judgment of this [ORG], the effect of that would have been to insist the respondent to seek compliance of[ SECTION_UNK]b of the Act by filing application in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. We have to keep in mind that the suit is pending in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and it is only the Madras High Court which would have considered such an application. However, even if such an application has been made by the respondent, [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] would have held that no such permission is required. Thus, approaching the [PERSON] High for this reason, before filing the rectification application before [ORG] would have been an empty formality. [ORG] could not have, therefore, rejected the application on the aforesaid ground as the party can not be directed to resort to the proceedings which may turn out to be infructuous. Had the case been before some other High Court, position would have been different. In the facts of this case, therefore, we hold that the application could not be dismissed as non maintainable in the absence of specific permission of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] under[ SECTION_UNK]b of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW]. This is more so when the plea of prior permission of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] was not even pressed when the writ petition was finally heard. Re The Claim of the respondent no.1 in the word ORZID per se [ORG] no.679 of [DATE] [DATE]. It was submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant that the respondent no.1s assertion of claiming statutory rights in the word ORZID per se is contrary to the express mandate of[ SECTION_UNK] of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW]. Argument proceeded on the basis that the registration of respondent [ORG] is in respect of trademark ORZID label mark and it is only a label which is protected.[ SECTION_UNK] of [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] reads as under However, the learned Single Judge has grossly erred in ignoring an important fact that [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] supra was decided under the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, [DATE], [DATE] which did not have a provision analogous to[ SECTION_UNK] of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW], [DATE]. The distinction between [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] supra and cases under[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act has been elaborately dealt with in [ORG] [ORG] supra from [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] of the said judgment. Observations in Para 27 of the impugned judgment is contrary to law. Para 27 of the impugned judgment discusses the argument that the label mark of respondent [ORG] does not confer rights over the word ORZID to respondent no.1. However, while dealing with this argument, the learned Single Judge wrongly relied upon [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] supra. The learned Single Judge also wrongly relied upon the case of Registrar of Trade Marks Vs. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON], AIR 1955 SC 558. The learned Single Judge failed to read paras [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] of Ashok Rakhit supra, where it was held as [DATE] [DATE]. The learned counsel concluded his submission on this aspect by submitting that the case of [ORG] [ORG] supra decided by the same Judge who has rendered the impugned judgment, protection in the parts of the trade mark, when only the whole had been registered, was disallowed in Para 14 of THAT judgment which reads as [DATE] [DATE]. The entire arguments are on the wrong premise and it proceeds on the basis of common feature of the [MONEY] [MONEY] suffix [ORG] and since the respondent has registration and [ORG] no.679 of [CARDINAL] trade mark ORZID, it can not bare a part of it, i.e., [ORG]. What has been seen in a case like this is as to whether the mark [ORG] is deceptively similar to ORZID. That is the test which is to be applied and in a process, it is to be seen as to whether the two marks are structurally and phonetically similar and would cause deception in the minds of consumers. When we judge the matter from this angle, we find ourselves in agreement with the view taken by [ORG] as well as the learned Single Judge. Although the mark ORZID is a label mark, the word mark ORZID is an essential feature which has been covered by the registration. Therefore, the learned counsel for the respondent appears to be right in his submission on this aspect, which is predicated on the [ORG] [ORG] decision in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] supra. Following dicta on the said decision is pertinent [CARDINAL]. We find that the learned Single Judge rightly held that when a label mark is registered, it can not be said that the word mark contained therein is not registered. We, thus, are of the opinion that although the word ORZID is a label mark, the word ORZID contained therein is also worthy of protection. The learned Single Judge has rightly observed that the judgment of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] supra is the complete answer. This aspect is considered and the argument of the appellant is rejected in the following words [CARDINAL]. We are in agreement with the aforesaid approach. Having regard to the aforesaid discussion, the case laws cited by the appellant will have no applicability to the facts of this case. Re Deceptive Similarity Between the Two Competing Marks [CARDINAL]. Numerous judgments were cited by the learned counsel for the appellant to contend that there was no deceptive similarity between the trade mark ORZID and trade mark [ORG] which are as follows [CARDINAL]. The learned counsel for the respondent argued to the contrary by submitting that but for the soft consonant F there is no difference between the rival marks. The marks ORZID and [ORG] are structurally and phonetically similar. The marks are nearly identical to each other. It is misconception that the marks are not identical merely because the suffix [ORG] is taken from [ORG]. Learned counsel highlighted that the appellant had taken the trademark of the Respondent no.1 and made a cosmetic change which would not be discernible by the public. He also submitted that it was a mala fide adoption of the mark with a view to encash upon the goodwill and reputation of the respondent [ORG], which was clear from the fact that the appellant obtained manufacturing license for the use of trade mark [ORG] in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and filed an application for registration of the mark on [DATE] under [PERSON] in Class-5. The mark was conceived and adopted by the appellant [DATE] [DATE] after the adoption and use of the nearly identical mark by the respondent [ORG]. It was, thus, a mala fide and tainted adoption. [CARDINAL]. The law on this aspect, where the Courts are called upon to consider the deceptive similarity between the two marks is firmly engraved in a series of judgments pronounced by [ORG] [ORG] in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] or more. Many are cited by the learned counsel for the appellant, note whereof is taken above. Judgment of Supreme Court in the case of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] supra, which deals with pharmaceutical LPA no.679 of [DATE] preparations, is a milestone on law relating to drugs. Application of the principles laid down in this judgment can be found in scores of subsequent judgments of this [ORG] and other [ORG] [ORG]. The position which emerges from the reading of all these judgments can be summarized in the following manner In such case, the central issue is as to whether the defendants activities or proposed activities amount to a misrepresentation which is likely to injure the business or goodwill of the plaintiff and cause damage to his business or goodwill. To extend this use to answer this, focus has to be on the aspect as to whether the defendant is making some representation in course of trade to prospective customers which is calculated to injure the business or goodwill of the plaintiff thereby causing damage to him. In the process, difference between the confusion and deception is to be understood. This difference was explained by Lord Denning in Difference Confusion Deception in the following words [CARDINAL]. While examining the question of misrepresentation or deception, comparison has to be made between the [CARDINAL] trademarks as a whole. Rules of Comparison was explained by [ORG] [ORG] in the following words [DATE]. Following Rules of Comparison can be culled out from various pronouncements of the Courts from time to time. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] not the correct way. [CARDINAL]. In this process, [ORDINAL], plaintiff is required to prove the following [DATE]. The appellant could not successfully pierce through the approach of the [CARDINAL] authorities below, which had taken into consideration of the judgments and the test laid down therein and application of the said test in the facts of the present case. In the present [ORG], we do not find any cause to take a different view or interfere with these findings of the fact. [CARDINAL]. The orders of the learned Single Judge and the [ORG] bench of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] were relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellant to contend that it was already held that there was no deceptive similarity between the appellants trademark and that of the respondent [ORG]. This argument is rightly brushed aside by the learned Single Judge holding that those orders were passed in application for interim injunction. While passing such orders, the [ORG] only takes prima facie view of the matter. [ORG], on the other hand, determined the issue finally on the basis of evidence produced before it and in this final determination it was not bound by the tentative observations which deciding the application for interim injunction under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure, [DATE] [DATE]. The learned Single Judge has also remarked that the [CARDINAL] findings of the learned Single Judge of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], viz., [CARDINAL] competing marks were phonetically similar and that the respondent [ORG] was a prior registered user, were affirmed by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. Moreover, the defence of the appellant herein before the learned Single Judge in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] put forth by the appellant herein and the proceedings before [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] was not accepted. The only factor which weighed, while taking prima facie view and refusing interim injunction was that the dosage of the [CARDINAL] drugs and their respective prices were different. We would like to quote from the following judgment in the case of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. [PERSON] [PERSON], [DATE] PTC 18 580 where the facet of likelihood of confusion even by the enlightened public was noticed in the following words This decision was approved by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in the case of [PERSON] [PERSON] and Another Supra. [CARDINAL]. We are, thus, of the opinion that the impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge does not call for any interference, as none of the arguments of the appellant is convincing enough to shake the correctness thereof. As a result, we dismiss this appeal being devoid of any merit with cost quantified at [CARDINAL].

      " [CARDINAL]. The petitioner is an Assistant Commandant in the respondent [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and is aggrieved by the fixation of his seniority and has filed the present petition with the following prayers- [CARDINAL]. The brief facts, as are relevant for the disposal of the petition, are that the petitioner had participated successfully in the examination notified in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and held by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] UPSC in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], for recruitment of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] A in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] CAPF including the CRPF and result of which examination was announced in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Vide letter dated [ORDINAL] December, 2007 [PERSON] [PERSON], the petitioner was offered appointment as Assistant [PERSON] in the [ORDINAL] Batch of the CRPF and was asked to report for basic training at [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], [GPE], [PERSON] [PERSON] on or before [ORDINAL] January, 2008 and informed that if no reply is received or you fail to report for training by the prescribed date, the offer of appointment shall be treated as cancelled. [CARDINAL]. The petitioner, by communication dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] conveyed his acceptance of the offer for recruitment but stated due to some private and domestic reasons, which is too important for myself and family, I am unable to join in commencing batch and requested.please give me extension to join after coming batches of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. The respondents vide letter dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] Annexure P-4 informed the petitioner that his request for extension of time had been accepted and he had been granted permission to enable him to join till the commencement of the basic training of the next batch of DAGOs. The letter aforesaid also recorded that his assigned seniority would be at the bottom of the next batch with which he would undergo training. The petitioner was further informed W.P. C [DATE] that the date of commencement of training will be communicated to him as and when finalized. [CARDINAL]. The petitioner joined the basic training course with the [ORDINAL] Batch and on successful completion thereof was issued an appointment letter dated [DATE] [DATE], [DATE] Annexure P-5. His name was placed at Serial no.78, at [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] Batch, as had been duly informed to him on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. It was only on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] that he submitted a representation against his placement, which was rejected on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] pointing out that it had been done in accordance with the OM dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. The petitioner also submitted another representation on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], which was also rejected on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] Annexures P-6 to [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. The OM dated [ORDINAL] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] lays down the following procedure for determination of seniority when the candidates recommended for appointment take long time to join or where the offers of appointment have been revived after they have been cancelled [CARDINAL]. The learned counsel for the petitioner, Ms. [PERSON] [PERSON] submitted that the reliance of the respondents on the OM dated [ORDINAL] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] was misplaced as his appointment had never been cancelled and he was not covered by Clause v of the said OM. She submitted that the petitioner was entitled to the benefit of the decision of this [ORG] in W.P.C10054 of [DATE] titled [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] of India Others decided on 24th August, [DATE], wherein it was held that Clause v of the OM dated [ORDINAL] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] was attracted only in cases where the appointment had been cancelled and subsequently restored and not in cases where the candidate had sought extension of time for joining the training and had been granted such extension. [CARDINAL]. We have heard learned counsel for the petitioner and considered the judgement relied upon by her as well as the material placed on the record. At [ORDINAL] blush, the facts appear to be similar in both cases. However, on scrutiny, we find that there are some material differences in both cases, as we shall discuss presently. [CARDINAL]. This court in [PERSON] [PERSON] supra was dealing with the case of a candidate who had been offered appointment as [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] A in the [ORDINAL] Batch of the [ORG] on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and was asked to report for basic training on [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] at [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in [GPE]. Vide letter dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], he had sought extension of [DATE] [DATE] to join the basic training on the ground that he was preparing for the Civil Services Mains to be held from [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] to 3rd [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. This request was acceded to vide letter dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] recording incorrectly that he had requested permission to join the next batch, which he had not, and was admittedly factually incorrect. The letter had stated that the request for extension had been examined in the light of letter no. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. I dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and the competent authority had allowed the petitioner to join [ORG], [ORG] with the next batch of Assistant [PERSON] [PERSON]. The letter had also stated that the seniority would be regulated by the provisions of the DoPT OM no.9/23/71 [ORG]. D dated [ORDINAL] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. The said candidate subsequently joined the basic training programme for Assistant [PERSON] [PERSON]. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] which commenced w.e.f. [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. When the Seniority List was published in [DATE] [DATE], he found himself placed at [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] Batch with which he had trained. He represented against such assignment of seniority and when the respondents informed him the seniority would be maintained vide letter dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], he moved the court. [CARDINAL]. These facts give rise to an impression that the case of the present petitioner is exactly on the same footing and that the view taken by this court in [PERSON] [PERSON] supra would apply on all fours to this case, viz. that the loss of seniority as a consequence of [ORG] v of the OM dated [ORDINAL] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] was harsh and significant and that the said [ORG] would not apply in all cases of extension of time to join, but would apply only W.P. C 3899/2020 when the offer of appointment had lapsed or stood cancelled automatically and was revived. It was held by the [ORG] as follows [CARDINAL]. Here the petitioner admittedly on his own, sought extension to join, not of a limited period of [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], but with the next batch of W.P. C 3899/2020 DAGOs and which could well be beyond [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], within the meaning of Clauses i and ii supra of the OM dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. The petitioner thus can not claim the benefit of Clauses i and ii of the OM dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. The case of the petitioner falls under Clause v of the OM dated [ORDINAL] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] of the petitioner not joining the post before the candidates of the next selection examination join but joining after some or all the candidates of the next selection examination had joined. Therefore, the interpretation given by this court in [PERSON] [PERSON] supra in the facts of that case would not apply to the facts of the present case. [CARDINAL]. Moreover, as noted by us in the order dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], there is much delay in the filing of the present petition. The petitioner had been specifically informed on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] that vide Clause v of the OM dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], he would be placed at the bottom of the batch with which he would train. When the appointment letter was issued to him on [DATE] [DATE], [DATE] [PERSON] [PERSON], he was shown at Serial no.78 at the bottom of the list, which also contained names of all those from the [ORDINAL] Batch with whom he had trained. Thus, it is amply clear that since [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], he knew that he would be placed at the bottom of the next batch and also knew that he had actually been so placed since [DATE] [DATE], [DATE]. But he did not protest. His [ORDINAL] representation is dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. The publication of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] will not suffice to explain the inaction of the petitioner as all along he acquiesced to the fact that he had lost his seniority. [CARDINAL]. It is to be noticed that after the publication of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], the representation of the petitioner dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] was rejected as early W.P. C [DATE] as in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. However, the petitioner did not initiate any legal action for the proper assignment of his seniority. He slept over the matter for [DATE] [DATE] till [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], when he made a fresh representation. This representation was also rejected on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. The present writ petition has been filed on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. There has been no explanation for these yawning delays in the action taken by the petitioner to protect his seniority. [CARDINAL]. Moreover, the facts of the present case are distinguishable from the case of [PERSON] [PERSON] supra. [ORDINAL], the petitioner himself had requested for being placed with the next batch for training, whereas [PERSON] [PERSON] had sought an extension of [DATE] [DATE]. The petitioner in his letter had, to quote, Further I request please give me extension to join after coming batches of DAGOs. [ORDINAL], the petitioner was duly informed that such a request had been acceded to, subject to his seniority being assigned at the bottom of the next batch. The respondents acceded to his clear request to join with subsequent batches, also cautioning in clear terms, to quote, You are further informed that you will be assigned seniority at the bottom of the next batch with which you will be undergoing basic training in accordance with provisions of sub para V b of DOPT PM no. 9/23/71- EsttD dated [CARDINAL]. This is in stark contrast to [PERSON] [PERSON] supra as such a consequence had not been lucidly and clearly told to him and so, till the publication of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], [PERSON] [PERSON] remained unaware of his assigned seniority. He also came to the [ORG] in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] itself immediately on rejection of his representation in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. [CARDINAL]. It can not also be overlooked that this [ORG] had found equities in favour of [PERSON] [PERSON], as he had succeeded in the examination with the [ORDINAL] rank out of [CARDINAL] candidates. This [ORG] found that he was never informed clearly and lucidly that he would be placed at the bottom of a subsequent batch with whom he would train and so had no chance to take a considered decision. The quoted letter of [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] was not in the public domain and so, [PERSON] [PERSON] was unaware that asking for extension would have such drastic consequences. No such equities exist in favour of the present petitioner as the letter acceding to his request clearly explained that he would be assigned seniority at the bottom of the subsequent batch. Moreover [PERSON] [PERSON] had sought extension of [DATE] [DATE] only and the action of not allowing him to join immediately after [DATE] [DATE] and of making him join with the next batch was attributable to the respondents therein. [CARDINAL]. The petition lacks in merit and is dismissed. ASHA MENON, [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON], [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], [CARDINAL] s.\n",

      " 25.05.2011 Introduction 1. The prayer in this writ petition is for a direction to [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] to frame appropriate and objective standards towards the determination and levying of royalties of various copyrighted works administered by Phonographic Performance Limited PPL, Respondent no. [CARDINAL], and [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], Respondent no. 4, or any other society that may be so created by it, and the mode of enforcing and administering such royalties when so fixed. A further direction is for investigation of the books of account of PPL and [ORG] to ascertain whether they have paid their dues to the owners authors of copyrights. Case of [FAC] [FAC] [FAC]. The Petitioner, Event and [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], is a society registered under [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW], [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. It comprises of members from all over [GPE] who are engaged in the business of organizing events, functions and entertainment shows like road shows, music concerts shows, brand promotion, dealers meet and other social events like marriages and get togethers etc. Individual members of [ORG] are stated to provide their services for organization of events and entertainment wherein they themselves are neither hosts nor guests but act merely as service providers. It is stated that during the aforesaid events and shows, the members of [ORG], as per the instructions of their clients, host or arrange or make arrangements for playing music recorded on tapes, compact discs, DVDs and other storage devices legally available in the markets. They also arrange for performance of live music, instrumental as well as singing of literary works in the form of songs by known as well as not so known artists performers. It is further stated that in all [CARDINAL] categories of events, i.e. social functions, brand promotion events and purely commercial events, live or recorded music is played or performed. [CARDINAL]. Respondent no. 1 has registered PPL and [ORG] as copyright societies in terms of[ SECTION] CR Act. While PPL is registered as a copyright society for sound recordings, [ORG] is for musical and literary works. The exploitation of a sound recording implies exploitation of the underlying literary or musical work as well. [CARDINAL] important function of the PPL and [ORG] is the business of granting licence in respect of the works wherein copyright exists and to charge royalties towards the same. Accordingly, the licence fee for the sound recordings on the one hand and the literary and musical works on the other have to be paid for separately by the users thereof to PPL and [ORG] respectively on behalf of their members who hold the relevant copyrights thereto. By a letter dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], the [ORG] [ORG] clarified that since the public performance of music involves mechanical rights in sound recording as well as rights of composers, performers etc. licences from both PPL and [ORG] have to be obtained for playing recorded music whose copyright administration vests in these [CARDINAL] societies. EEMA contends that Respondent no.1 has failed to exercise its jurisdiction under[ SECTION_UNK] CR Act to set down any objective standards and criteria for charging of royalties by [ORG] and [ORG]. It is stated that both the PPL and [ORG] are acting arbitrarily in fixing tariffs with no objective standards and have assumed the role of the W.P. C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] legislature in fixing the amount of royalties at their sole discretion, the role of a law enforcer in enforcing the collection of such royalties and in taking coercive action against the members of [ORG]. It is stated that demanding of royalties for playing music at social functions and events is a violation of[ SECTION_UNK] CR Act. It is submitted that inasmuch as Respondent no. 1 has a constitutional obligation under[ SECTION] not to act arbitrarily or unreasonably the same applies to copyright societies like [ORG] and [ORG], constituted under[ SECTION_UNK] CR Act. It is further submitted that the valuable rights of the members of [ORG] to carry on their trade under[ SECTION] can not be violated by the PPL and IPRSL. Stand of Respondent no. 3 PPL 4. In its counter affidavit PPL contended that by the amendments brought about by [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW], [DATE] Amendment Act [DATE], the erstwhile provisions of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] relating to performing right societies were replaced. The new [LAW] [LAW] contains elaborate provisions regarding the conduct, self governance and accountability of the management of all copyright societies. The contention is that under the amended provisions copyright societies are made strictly accountable to their owners, do not enjoy any monopoly, and their licence fees are subject to market forces. It is submitted that the amended provisions of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] reflect the current legislative policy, encompassing economic policy. It is submitted that the writ jurisdiction can not be invoked to intervene in such policy. It is further submitted that [ORG] has not supplied any data which could justify its apprehension that the licence fees as determined by PPL are unreasonable. It is submitted that members of [ORG] who are themselves organizers of events costing lakhs and crores of rupees can not plead their inability to pay the modest licence fees charged by the copyright societies. It is pointed out that in relation to every kind of dispute regarding the subsistence of copyright or liability for infringement there are civil remedies provided under [LAW] [LAW] of [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT]. In many cases many of the members of [ORG] have been paying licence fees to PPL and other owners of copyright for their live events. It is submitted that the present petition has been filed only with a view to avoid payment of licence fees. It is further submitted that [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] does not contain a clause whereby EEMA may sue or be sued. There is no authorization by the governing body of EEMA for filing the present petition. [CARDINAL]. Explaining the importance and utility of copyright societies, PPL states that the amended provisions of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] in a sense acknowledge the difficulties of the members of the copyright societies in individually enforcing their copyrights. Individual members of copyright societies can not also be expected to identify and chase broadcasting organizations, shops, ships, aircrafts, departmental stores, showrooms, emporiums, restaurants, hotels, clubs, offices, organizers of live concerts etc. all over the world where the copyrighted works may be used or commercially exploited. Copyright societies collect royalties after deduction of administrative expenses as prescribed under Rule 14H of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW], [DATE] [ORG] [ORG] which are distributed amongst the members of the copyright societies in proportion to the actual use of the works of such members subject to the scheme which are approved by the members. It is asserted that the fee structure fixed by PPL is collectively decided by the members of the PPL in an Annual General Meeting AGM. PPL is required to fix tariffs at a level which balances affordability of music to users and at the same time ensures fair returns. It is submitted that the fee structures fixed by PPL are reasonable and in fact work out only to a negligible and insignificant percentage of the turnover of, for example, shops, departmental stores, showrooms, emporiums, hotels, pubs and restaurants, or of the cost of high profile events such as those organized by the members of [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. Copies of the Gazette Notification dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] giving a complete list of the types of licence and the corresponding fees to be paid, as partially modified and published in [LOC] [LOC] [LOC] dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], have been enclosed with the counter affidavit of PPL. The licences issued by the [LOC] can broadly be classified into [CARDINAL] separate categories [DATE] licenses granted to various establishments for playing the sound recordings administered by PPL as piped music or background music etc. in their respective establishments [DATE] licence and, individual licences granted to an establishment for playing sound records belonging to PPLs repertoire during an event show organized by the establishments on special occasions like [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] event licence. Most of the hotels have obtained both [DATE] and event licences keeping in view the separate sets of rights flowing from the particular licences. It is stated that by paying an [DATE] fee to PPL, an establishment obtains automatic and blanket permission to play music from the vast collection of [CARDINAL] of songs, both [NORP] and foreign. No time and cost is lost in either travelling or in entering into any other form of negotiations with the right holders. Further, uniform rates are charged, W.P. C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] eliminating the difficulty that a user may face from some particular, unreasonable copyright owner. Further, the emphasis of the whole system is to provide a single window clearance through which a user gets quick, automatic permission without any cost of travel or negotiation for all works. A list of countries in which such systems are prevalent has been enclosed with PPLs counter affidavit. Stand of Respondent no. [CARDINAL] [ORG] [ORG]. Respondent no. 4, [ORG], in its counter affidavit raises more or less the same preliminary objection as the PPL. It is stated that [ORG] is affiliated to [CARDINAL] world societies of authors and composers, which are included within its Federation, i.e. [ORG], [GPE] established under the auspicious of [ORG] and [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART], [DATE] harter. [ORG] is also a member of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] CEAC set up by the Government of India to advise the government regarding measures for improving the enforcement of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW]. The members of [ORG] comprising of authors, composers and publishers of [NORP] literary and musical works have executed deeds of assignment, assigning their public performing rights and communication to the public rights in respect of their literary and or musical works including such literary and musical works which they may own in the future, in favour of [ORG]. It is asserted that for [ORG], this is the most efficacious way of enforcing the rights of its members as this allows [ORG] to act more efficiently. Since the membership is for a limited set of rights and subsists during the membership of [ORG], the interests of individual members are also protected. The membership of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], comprises lyricists, music composers, music publishers comprising of music companies film other audio visual producers. It is pointed out that [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] recognizes lyrics writers and music composers created works as literary and musical works and they belong to a number of categories like musical compositions and performances. The owner of the copyright in the literary or musical works enjoys a number of rights exclusively, which are set out in[ SECTION_UNK] a of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW]. [CARDINAL]. The counter affidavit of [ORG] illustrates the advantages enjoyed by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] or the members of [ORG]. It also illustrates the advantages to those like the Petitioner who obtained licences for use of such copyright work from [ORG]. It is stated that royalty rates fixed by [ORG] are relative to the value of the music to the establishment concerned. It is stated that the object, therefore, while fixing tariffs, is to W.P. C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] ensure affordability and at the same time ensure just rewards to the creators of music. The counter affidavit of [ORG] refers to [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] which provided for an exhaustive procedure for application and conditions for grant of permission to carry on the copyright business. It is further stated that the conditions set out under [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], [DATE] are tailored to satisfy the registering authority of the collective nature of the applicant. [CARDINAL]. It is stated that working of the copyright societies continues to be monitored and guided by [LAW] [LAW] [LAW]. A copyright society is expected to submit a report of returns under [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON]. Rule 14P [ORG] [ORG] requires [ORG] to submit [DATE] returns which would contain various details such as audited accounts of the society, tariff scheme, distribution scheme, and a declaration from the governing body of [ORG] as regards all its activities. It is submitted that the tariff fixed by [ORG] may be called into question before the [ORG] under[ SECTION_UNK] CR Act. Inasmuch as the tariff in the present case has been fixed by [ORG] diligently and after collective decision of the members of [ORG] taken in an AGM it can not be said to be arbitrary, unreasonable or violative of any provision of any law. It is stated that there are adequate safeguards provided within [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] to check the consequences of any perceived excessive delegation inasmuch as[ SECTION_UNK] 4 CR Act provides that the central government may, if it is satisfied that a copyright society is being managed in a manner detrimental to the interest of the owners of the copyrights, cancel the registration of such society after such inquiry, as may be prescribed. Under[ SECTION_UNK] CR Act, the central government can also call for any report or any record of any copyright society for the purpose of satisfying itself that the fees collected by the society in respect of rights administered by it are being utilized or distributed in accordance with the provisions of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW]. Stand of Respondent no. 1 UOI 10. The counter affidavit filed by Respondent no. 1, [ORG], on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], did not deal with the contention raised by the Petitioner that monopoly rights are being created in favour of societies without any regulatory mechanism to deal with arbitrary price fixation. Consequently, by an order dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], this [ORG] directed the [ORG] to file an additional affidavit. On [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] were further granted to file the said additional affidavit. After costs were imposed by an order dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], the [ORG] filed the said additional affidavit on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. It is pointed W.P. C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] out by the [ORG] that the disputes involving royalty licence fee are sub judice, at the instance of some of the members of [ORG] before [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. It is contended that since an efficacious remedy is available to EEMA before the [ORG], the present writ petition ought not to be entertained. The affidavit of [ORG] also sets out the chronology of the litigation and the record of evidence before the CB in the various petitions relating to fixation of royalty and licence fee for various copyright works in which some of the members of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] are involved. The list of writ petitions and the issues pending in this [ORG] have also been set out. EEMAs stand in rejoinder [CARDINAL]. EEMA has, in response to the additional affidavit, filed a reply on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] pointing out that the said additional affidavit does not answer the contention of the Petitioners that the copyright societies have deliberately created a monopoly in the fixation of tariff and royalty and that they have acted in an arbitrary and unjust manner. It is pointed out that in its order dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] in the case of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] v. Phonographic Performance Limited [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] the [GPE] has noticed that there are no reasonable standards or data available on the basis of which the [GPE] can determine royalty rates and that they have to act only on the basis of a best judgment assessment which is open to the arbitrariness, uncertainty, modifications and alterations. [ORG] has also filed copies of the tariff schedule of PPL, the extracts of the audited accounts [ORG], a sampling of the agreements entered into between the owners of copyright and IPRSL 12. This [ORG] has heard the submissions of Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON], learned counsel appearing for the Petitioner, Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON], learned counsel for the [ORG], Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON], learned Senior counsel and Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON] learned counsel for PPL and Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON], learned counsel on behalf of [ORG]. The statutory scheme under [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW]. The relevant provisions of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] and [ORG] [ORG] may be referred to [ORDINAL].[ SECTION_UNK] CR Act prior to its amendment provided for a performing rights society [ORG] under [LAW] [LAW]. Under[ SECTION_UNK] 1 of the unamended CR Act, every [ORG] was to furnish to the Registrar of Copyrights Registrar a statement of all fees, charges or royalties which it proposed to collect for the grant of licences for performance in public of works W.P. C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] in respect of which it had authority to grant such licences. Failure to do so disentitled the [ORG] from initiating action in relation to performing that work except with the consent of the Registrar. Under[ SECTION_UNK] of the unamended CR Act, any person having any objections to any fees, charges or royalties or other particulars included in any statement referred to in[ SECTION_UNK] may at any time lodge such objections in writing at [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. Both objections were to be decided under[ SECTION_UNK] of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW]. [LAW] [LAW] [LAW], [DATE] introduces the concept of the copyright societies under[ SECTION_UNK] of [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT], which as amended in [DATE] reads as [DATE] [DATE]. PPL and the [ORG] are both registered under[ SECTION_UNK] 3 CR Act. Under[ SECTION_UNK] 5 CR Act, the central government can, in the interests of the owners of copyrights, suspend the registration of a copyright society pending inquiry for such period not exceeding one year. Under[ SECTION_UNK] 4 CR Act the central government can cancel the registration of a copyright society after inquiry if it is satisfied that the copyright society is being managed in a manner detrimental to the interests of the owners of rights concerned. Further, the administration of rights of owners by a copyright society is provided in[ SECTION_UNK] of [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT], which reads as [DATE] [DATE]. Further, under[ [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] special rights can be conferred on a copyright W.P. C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] society in respect of certain classes of works.[ SECTION_UNK] A reads as [DATE] [DATE]. The control over the copyright society by the owner of rights is specified under[ SECTION_UNK] reads as [DATE] [DATE]. There is an obligation of the copyright society to submit returns and reports under[ SECTION_UNK] CR Act which reads as [DATE] [DATE]. This has to be read along with [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] which reads as [DATE] [DATE]. The above provisions make it clear that in their functioning the copyright societies are controlled by and are accountable to the owners of the copyrights. There is also an overall supervisory control by the central government. As regards the power to fix tariffs, the earlier scheme under the unamended CR Act has been consciously departed from by the legislature. There are checks put in place in terms of[ SECTION_UNK] 3 at the time of registration of a copyright society. The central government has to account for the interests of authors and other owners of rights as well as the interests and convenience of the public and in particular of the groups of persons who are most likely to seek licences. Once a copyright society is registered, the control that can be exercised over it by the central government and by the owners of the copyrights is as given in[ SECTION_UNK] CR Act. Instead of the central government itself controlling the fixation of royalty tariff, the legislature has required the copyright society to fix tariffs subject to obtaining approval of the owners of rights. This is as regards the procedure of collection and distribution of fees as well as for the utilization of any amounts collected as fees for any purpose other than distribution to the owner of rights. The copyright society will provide to such owners regular, full and detailed information concerning all its activities in relation to the administration of their rights. The above statutory provisions have been supplemented by Rules [CARDINAL], [DATE], [DATE], [GPE], [DATE], [CARDINAL] G, [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], [DATE] and 14 K CR Rules. In addition Rule 14L CR Rules provides for meeting of copyright societies, [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] provides for accounts and proper audit. Under Rule 14L, as soon as [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] are prepared, the copyright society is to call a general meeting of the owners of rights whose names are recorded in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] to approve the same. Under Rule 14N, within [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] from the holding of a meeting, an [ORG] is to be held of the owners of rights. The documents to be presented in the annual general W.P. C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] meeting of owners of rights are listed out under [LAW] [LAW] Under Rule 14P, returns are to be filed by the copyright societies with the Registrar of Copyrights. In other words, under [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW], a very detailed procedure has been laid out to regulate the working of copyright societies. This has to be further understood in the context of[ SECTION_UNK] CR Act which provides for assignment of copyright. Such assignment is a pre condition to becoming a member of [ORG] or any other copyright society. As a result of such assignment the copyright society becomes the exclusive owner of the public performing rights of its members. Under[ SECTION_UNK] a CR Act, the bundle of rights constituting the rights in a literary, dramatic or musical work, not being a computer programme has been set out.[ SECTION_UNK] c CR Act specifies the rights in an artistic work and[ SECTION_UNK] e the rights in a sound recording. Performing rights would include the right to perform the work, the right to communicate the work to the public by making any cinematograph film or sound recording in respect of the work.[ SECTION_UNK] c which defines artistic work,[ SECTION_UNK] d which defines author,[ SECTION_UNK] ffa which defines composer,[ SECTION_UNK] qq which defines performer and[ SECTION_UNK] uu which defines producer, acknowledge the entire range of persons who may have rights in a musical work, an artistic work, a literary work or a performance, each of which have also been defined. [CARDINAL]. The entire bundle of rights which are acknowledged and protected in terms of[ SECTION_UNK] a of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] which also sets out the meaning of copyright. That there is extensive use of musical and artistic works and sound recordings by event organizers is acknowledged by [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW]. The interests of both the copyright owners and the users have been sufficiently addressed in these amendments. Copyright societies were given the powers to fix the tariff but only with the approval of the owners of copyrights who are its members. Learned counsel for [ORG] and [ORG] have rightly pointed out that their clients not only serve the interests of their members but the community of users as well. Once the users of work obtain a licence from the copyright societies in respect of a copyrighted work, their user of such work becomes legal. The payment of the tariff as demanded by the copyright societies ensures that they will have no individual dispute between the user of the copyright and the owner of the copyright or members of the copyright societies. Functioning of copyright societies in other jurisdictions [DATE]. The system of having copyright societies to fix and administer royalties and tariffs in copyright work is not unique to [GPE]. There are Collective Management Organizations CMOs that have been prevalent in [GPE] since [DATE] [DATE]. The government there has, therefore, introduced a system of extensive monitoring and control of such CMOs. A [ORG] constituted is empowered to access all documents, data and software used by a [ORG] and also to question the CMOs auditors, wherein confidentiality obligation of such auditor would be suspended. Moreover, members are given the right to obtain specific information from their [ORG]. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], [DATE] in [GPE] mandates publication or tariffs. It requires that in establishing tariffs and in collecting the remuneration, collecting societies shall have due regard to religion, cultural and social interests of the persons liable to pay the remuneration. In [GPE] [GPE] [GPE], the copyright collecting societies have emerged as a prominent private mechanism to monitor infringement and for management of copyrights. The tariff is fixed by negotiating with the association of users. There is no role assigned to [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in the [GPE] to regulate the relationship between the societies and users. In [GPE] [GPE] [GPE] there are performing rights societies which are entrusted with the task of enforcing copyrights on behalf of the owners of the copyright. For the purposes of compulsory licensing, copyright offices can establish Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panels to determine reasonable terms and rates of royalty payments. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] lays down certain principles for the functioning of the cooperative societies [CARDINAL]. What is relevant is that each country has its system of state regulation of the functioning of copyright and performing rights societies. The practice and legislative policy of [CARDINAL] country can not ipso facto be adopted in another. What is reasonable and W.P. C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] permissible within the legal and constitutional framework has to be examined with reference to the position in our country. As far as [GPE] is concerned [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] and CR Rules provide for a complete scheme. Given that the constitutional validity of the relevant provisions concerning copyright societies has been upheld, those provisions have to be given full effect to. [CARDINAL]. Mr. [PERSON] relied upon the passages from [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] by [PERSON] [PERSON] and [PERSON] [PERSON], Oxford [DATE], in which it is stated that having a single body solely responsible for administering rights of copyright owners posed problems for both members and users. It is stated that problems with members typically occur because a copyright owner has little alternative to joining the society, which can thus impose restrictive terms. The authors point out that a [ORDINAL] set of problems arises from the relations with users, who similarly have little alternative but to take a licence from the collecting society on whatever terms it chooses. Due to these problems, collecting societies have been described in terms similar to the atom bomb as at once the most ingenious and the worst invention of mankind. While the above problems might still occur as far as the PPL and [ORG] are concerned,[ SECTION_UNK] 4 and 33 5 and[ SECTION_UNK] read with[ SECTION_UNK] CR Act provide adequate safeguards. It is not as if the copyright societies under [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] have a free run as regards the fixation of tariffs and royalties in copyright works. Tariffs fixed by PPL and IRPSL not an arbitrary exercise of power [CARDINAL]. The contention on behalf of EEMA that by delegating all the powers in relation to fixation of tariffs to the copyright societies, the central government has abdicated its essential function under [LAW] [LAW] [LAW], overlooks the fact that the legislature has made a conscious shift from the statutory scheme whereby central government retained a regulatory power over the fixation of tariffs. This petition is not concerned with the validity of the amended provisions. A Division Bench of this [ORG] has, in a judgment recently passed on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] in [ORG] [ORG] no. [CARDINAL] of [DATE] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of [GPE] upheld the constitutional validity of[ SECTION_UNK] 3 and 34 3 of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] as amended read with[ SECTION_UNK] xx and[ SECTION_UNK] thereof. This [ORG] negatived the prayer made in that petition by the users of copyrighted works for a direction against PPL for charging fees for special events licence and the rates notified by PPL for [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] for the special events. This Court W.P. C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] upheld the preliminary objection raised by the [ORG] and the PPL that the Petitioners in that case ought to have approached the Registrar if they had a grievance about the quantum of charges demanded by PPL and IPRSL for grant of compulsory licence in respect of copyrighted works. It was further observed by this [ORG] that the user should first take up the grievance with the government and persuade it to exercise the powers under[ SECTION_UNK] CR Act if the user was aggrieved by the manner of functioning of the copyright societies. Answering in the negative the specific question that are any of the provisions of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW], [DATE] or [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] [DATE] framed thereunder ultra vires the constitution, this [ORG] relied upon the judgment in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] v. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] as well as the observations in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [CARDINAL] SCC 30. In para [CARDINAL] of the judgment the Division Bench of this [ORG] observed as [DATE] [DATE]. Bound as it is by the judgment of the Division Bench, which in turn relied upon the judgments of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], this [ORG] declines to further examine the issue of unreasonableness of the tariffs fixed by PPL or [ORG] or the scope of their powers in that regard under[ SECTION_UNK] CR Act read with [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. Mr. [PERSON] referred to the tariff schedule of the PPL and certain extracts of the statement of accounts of the [ORG] to urge that the money collected by them as royalties was not being defrayed for appropriate purposes. The question whether the copyright societies have discharged their functions in accordance with [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] must be examined in the [ORDINAL] instance by the central government in which adequate powers have been vested under[ SECTION_UNK] 4 read with[ SECTION_UNK] 3 CR Act. The owners of the copyright too have adequate supervisory control over the functioning of the copyright societies of which they are members. Nothing has been shown to indicate that the procedure outlined by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] has not been followed by the copyright societies in the fixation of tariffs. What should be the appropriate tariff for a copyrighted work, how the royalties and fees collected should be distributed amongst the owners of different rights are issues which are required to be left to be determined by the copyright societies working under the control of the copyright owners. In any event, this [ORG] is not equipped to entertain a disputed question of fact in relation to the fixation of tariffs in a writ petition under[ SECTION]. This [ORG] is therefore not persuaded to hold that the PPL or [ORG] have acted arbitrarily or unreasonably in fixing tariffs for copyrighted works. Not a case of excessive delegation of legislative powers [CARDINAL]. It was then urged by Mr. [PERSON] that under[ SECTION_UNK] [CARDINAL] c, [GPE], cf, d da and db, it is for the central government to make rules and not for the copyright societies to take over from the central government the functions of collection and distribution of fees, approval for utilization of any amount collected as fees, the manner of payment of royalties and maintenance of accounts. Mr. [PERSON] relied upon the judgments concerning excessive delegation including [PERSON] [PERSON] v. Union of India AIR 1960 SC 554, [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] v. [PERSON] of India 2000 SCC 57, [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] of [FAC] [FAC] 1997 SC 3400 and Chandrakant [PERSON] [PERSON] v. State of [ORG] [ORG] [DATE] [ORG] [ORG]. He sought to make a distinction between conditional legislation and delegated legislation and urged that tariff fixation itself was a legislative activity which was delegated to the central government by the [ORG] and W.P. C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] which could not have been further delegated to the copyright societies. [CARDINAL]. This [ORG] is unable to agree with the above submission of Mr. [PERSON]. Rules have been framed by the central government under[ SECTION_UNK] CR Act. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] the CR Rules concerns copyright societies. The rules thereunder are relatable to[ SECTION_UNK] [CARDINAL] c, ca and 78 2 d, da and db [ORG] [ORG]. The central government has laid down the procedure to be followed by copyright societies in obtaining approval of the owners of rights for collection and distribution of fees. It details the procedure for copyright societies to draw up [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] which are defined under Rule 14J and 14 K of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] respectively. Rules 14J and 14 K read as [DATE] [DATE]. A detailed procedure has been laid down for holding meetings of the copyright societies, including the [ORG], for approval of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW]. This is followed by filing of the returns with the Registrar of Copyrights. Given the scope of[ SECTION_UNK] 3 the legislative intent is to give the copyright societies the power to fix the tariff but in consultation with the approval of the owners of copyrights. The role of the government under [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] is that of oversight of the functioning of the copyright societies under[ SECTION_UNK] 3, 4 and 5 CR Act.[ [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] authorizes the central government to call for any report and also call for any records of the copyright society. The central governments power of rule making under[ SECTION_UNK] 2 is only with regard to the conditions subject to which a copyright society may issue licences, collect fees and distribute such fees amongst owners of rights[ SECTION_UNK] 2 ce, manner of determining any royalties payable[ SECTION_UNK] 2 d, the manner of payment of W.P. C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] royalty[ SECTION_UNK] 2 da and obtaining approval of owners of copyright to utilization of the fees collected and distributed[ SECTION_UNK] 2 cf. The relevant CR Rules referred to hereinbefore adequately deal with each of the above areas. There is no ambiguity. It is not as if there is no legislative guidance or norms that can be discerned from these provisions. They constitute sufficient safeguards to ensure that the exercise of these powers by the copyright societies is not arbitrary or unreasonable. This [ORG] is, therefore, unable to agree with the learned counsel for the Petitioner that this is a case of excessive delegation of legislative powers by the central government to the copyright societies. [CARDINAL]. In [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] discussed the provisions of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] in detail. It has spelt out the scope of the powers of the copyright societies. It pointed out that [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] itself maintained a balance between the interests of the owner of copyright in protecting his work on the one hand and the interest of the public in having access to such work on the other. This [ORG] is not persuaded to hold that the fixation of tariff or royalties by [ORG] and IPRSL in exercise of their powers under [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] is per se arbitrary or unreasonable. [CARDINAL]. Having said that, it must be emphasized that any challenge to an instance of tariff fixation by PPL or IPRSL can be raised before the [ORG]. In fact, this has already been done. The case sent on remand to [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] following the judgment of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] has already been adjudicated by the [ORG]. It is not, therefore, as if there is no remedy available to the user of the copyright who is aggrieved by the fixation of tariff by a copyright society. Conclusion [CARDINAL]. For all the aforesaid reasons, this [ORG] is not inclined to grant any of the reliefs as prayed for. The writ petition is dismissed with no order as to costs. The pending application is disposed of.

      " [PERSON] [PERSON], [LAW] [LAW]. The appellant namely [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON], vide the present appeal assails the impugned judgment dated [DATE] and the impugned order on sentence dated 23.03.2019 of the learned ASJ-01, [GPE] [GPE], [GPE], [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] POCSO in [PERSON] [PERSON] no.44/2017 vide which the appellant herein was convicted for the offence punishable under[ SECTION] and[ SECTION_UNK] of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], [DATE] hereinafter referred to as POCSO Act, [DATE] and was sentenced to undergo [ORG] [ORG] for a period of [DATE] [DATE] along [PERSON]. A.865/2019 with a fine of [ORG] and in default of the payment of fine, to further undergo [ORG] [ORG] for a period of [DATE] [DATE] for the offence punishable under[ SECTION] and was sentenced to undergo [ORG] [ORG] for a period of [DATE] [DATE] along with a fine of [DATE] and in default of the payment of fine, to further undergo [ORG] [ORG] for a period of [DATE] [DATE] for the offence punishable under[ SECTION_UNK] of the POCSO Act, [DATE], with it having been directed that both the sentences would run concurrently. [CARDINAL]. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] Record was requisitioned, has been received and has been perused. [CARDINAL]. The nominal roll received from the Superintendent Jail-04, [GPE], [GPE] indicates that on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], the appellant herein had undergone a period of [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and [DATE] [DATE] of incarceration with a period of [DATE] [DATE] of remission with the unexpired portion of the sentence being [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and [DATE] [DATE] in the event of having remaining unpaid, which in the instant case has apparently not been paid. The jail conduct of the appellant has been reported to be satisfactory. [CARDINAL]. The appellant in the instant case as indicated vide the impugned judgment of the learned [ORG] [ORG] has been identified by the victim C aged [DATE] [DATE] as being the person who had on [CARDINAL] forcibly taken her towards the bushes and then he inserted his peshab wali jagah in her peshab wali jagah and on her screaming, he had run away and the minor child victim C also identified the appellant as being the person known as [PERSON] ka chacha Rinku who had lifted her [PERSON]. A.865/2019 and taken her towards the bushes, where he had removed his under wear and the minor childs under wear and then inserted his penis into her vagina and she thus, screamed out of pain and then that boy had run away. The factum of the commission of the aggravated penetrative sexual assault in terms of[ SECTION_UNK] of the POCSO Act, [DATE] having been inflicted on the victim C, has not been disputed by the appellant and the same is also clearly brought forth through the [ORG] of the minor victim C dated [CARDINAL] which shows the hymen torn the orifice being [QUANTITY] [QUANTITY], though the child was not allowing proper examination. [CARDINAL]. The mother Smt. P of the victim C examined as [PERSON] had stated in her testimony on oath before the learned [ORG] [ORG] that on [DATE] at [TIME] [TIME] [TIME], she was cooking food and the victim C was watching television in the house sitting beside her and after [TIME] [TIME] [TIME], the child had gone to play with the children in the gali and after some time a girl named N came to her i.e. Smt. P and informed that something had happened to the minor child victim C and she was bleeding from her thighs, then the mother Smt. P of the minor child victim C rushed immediately with N and reached at the corner of the gali where she found her daughter i.e. C standing and she was bleeding from her thighs and thus, she i.e. Smt. P took her back to the house and checked her internal parts of the body after removing her underwear and she found that the blood was oozing from her private part and on inquiry, the minor child victim C told her mother Smt. P that one boy who lives in the area took her in the jungle and committed wrong act and later on, the minor child victim C told the Crl. A.865/2019 name of that person was Jaanu ka [ORG], i.e. [PERSON] and further informed her mother Smt. P that the accused i.e. the appellant herein had put his private part into her private part usne apne shu shu mere shu shu main daal diya and when she cried, the accused had run away from there after leaving the child in the jungle. [CARDINAL]. The prosecutrix victim i.e. the minor child i.e. C examined as PW-3 before the learned [ORG] [ORG] aged [DATE] [DATE] at the time when her testimony was recorded on 13.12.2017 was examined by the learned [ORG] [ORG] to ascertain whether she was capable of understanding the questions and gave rational answers and on being satisfied that the minor child was capable of giving rational answers put to her, the minor child i.e. C was examined by the learned [ORG] [ORG] without administering her oath in view of her tender age, in which she stated to the effect- [CARDINAL]. The minor child through her testimony was categorical to the effect that the person who committed rape on her was the accused. On behalf of the appellant, it was contended that it was a case of mistaken identity, in as much as the child in the [ORDINAL] statement given to her mother had told her that a tall boy who lived in the same area where they lived had forcibly picked her up in his arms and had taken her into the bushes in front of the lane and had committed a wrong act with her and had [ORDINAL] taken of his under wear and the minor childs underwear and then inserted his penis into her vagina and thus she had started shouting, then he left her and ran away and it was thus submitted on behalf of the appellant that even though, the minor child victim stated that the person lived in the area where the minor child [PERSON]. A.865/2019 victim lived, the name of the appellant was not given by the child nor was it mentioned in the [ORG] and rather through the [ORG], the complainant i.e. P, the mother of the minor child victim had stated that some unknown boy had committed rape on her child. [CARDINAL]. In relation to this aspect, it is essential to observe that through her statement recorded under[ SECTION]. on [CARDINAL], the mother of the victim i.e. C had clearly given the name of the appellant as being the person who had taken away her child into the bushes and raped her, in as much as she stated that she had taken her child i.e. the victim C to [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and she was medically examined and there a girl named Z asked some questions to her daughter i.e. to the minor child victim C who had named the accused i.e. the appellant herein Rinku who also named as [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] who had picked her up and had taken her and had committed a wrong act with her through the susuwala Raasta. [CARDINAL]. The minor child victim C through her statement under[ SECTION]. dated [PRODUCT] had also categorically stated to the effect that she was burning some fire and taking some heat and then [ORG] ka chacha came, whose name was [PERSON] and picked her up in his arms, took her to the jungle and then caused her pain in her vagina and blood came out and took off her underwear and also his underwear and again caused her pain and the child pointed towards her vagina and also stated that the accused i.e. the appellant put his finger into the same and then also put his penis into her vagina. [CARDINAL]. The minor child examined as [ORG] whose testimony has also been adverted to hereinabove, categorically identified the accused [PERSON]. A.865/2019 person in the [ORG] from the wooden partition as being the person who had committed the aggravated penetrative sexual assault on her and the minor child victim has also categorically stated even through her statement made in the [ORG] on 13.12.2017 that the person who had picked her up and took her away and had committed the offence of penetrative assault on her was the person known as [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON]. As is well settled the statement of the minor child would suffice when held trustworthy which it is so held in the facts and circumstances of the instant case to incriminate and bring forth the charge of allegations that was framed against the appellant on 29.04.2017 of the commission of the offences punishable under[ SECTION] and[ SECTION_UNK]m of the POCSO Act punishable under[ SECTION_UNK] of the POCSO Act, [DATE]. [CARDINAL]. Through his statement under[ SECTION], the accused i.e. the appellant herein has not refuted that he is [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and only claims that he has been falsely implicated in the matter, in as much as there were no talking terms between his family and the victims family. The accused had also stated through his statement under[ SECTION] that the victim had been tutored and had earlier stated that the person who had committed the offence upon her was ek lamba ladka i.e. a tall boy and that he himself was a short heighted person. During the course of the submissions that were made on behalf of the accused i.e. the appellant herein, it was submitted that the appellant was [QUANTITY] [QUANTITY] in height. Taking into account the factum that the prosecutrix is a minor who was of [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] at the time of the commission of the offence, the height of [PERSON]. A.865/2019 [QUANTITY] [QUANTITY] certainly falls within the ambit of a person being tall for a minor child. [CARDINAL]. The circumstances of the instant case thus, do not in any manner bring forth that the identity of the appellant is in any manner in dispute and taking into account the factum that the child through her [ORDINAL] statement under[ SECTION] had stated that the person who committed the aggravated penetrative sexual assault on her was [ORG] ka [ORG], taking into account the factum that the prosecutrix identified the accused i.e. the appellant before [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] as being that person who committed the said offence on her and taking into account the factum that the prosecutrix through her testimony coupled with the factum that the prosecutrix through her statement before the [ORG] stated that the person who committed the offence on her was that [ORG] ka [ORG], it becomes apparent that the identity of the appellant as being the sole perpetrator of the crime committed on the minor child, has been established beyond a reasonable doubt and to the hilt. [CARDINAL]. The demeanour of the minor child as observed by the learned trial Court that the child victim on seeing the accused from the wooden partition when she correctly identified them seeks volume against the accused appellant and establishes the identity of the accused i.e. the appellant herein of being the perpetrator of the crime. [CARDINAL]. As regards, the contention raised on behalf of the appellant that there have been varying statements made by the minor child, it is essential to observe as laid down by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of this [ORG] in [ORG]. [ORG]. no. [CARDINAL] titled as COURT ON ITS OWN Crl. A.865/2019 [PERSON] [PERSON]. STATE, wherein it has been observed vide paragraph [CARDINAL] to the effect- [CARDINAL]. As regards the aspect of the lack of corroboration to the testimony of the minor prosecutrix, it is essential to observe as laid down by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of this [ORG] in Baljeet Singh Ors. Vs. State of [GPE] and [ORG]. in [GPE]. A.386, [CARDINAL], [DATE] and 1080/ [DATE], the competency of a child witness to give evidence is not regulated by the age but by the degree of understanding he she appears to possess. The observations of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of this [ORG] in [ORG] [ORG] and [ORG]. Vs. State of [GPE] and [ORG]. supra in paragraphs [CARDINAL], [DATE] [DATE], which read to the effect- [CARDINAL]. [CARDINAL] of the issues marring the growth of our country is the evil of child sexual abuse which we hear very often. The POCSO Act, [DATE] was therefore formulated in order to effectively address the heinous crimes of sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children. There lies no iota of doubt that it takes great amount of grit and courage to distinctly explain the horrendous incident that a child is made to go through because of certain ruthless section of the society. A child however even at a tender age does possess the ability to answer the questions put to her him spontaneously if she he was present at the site of crime or if he she has been a victim herself. It is even the courts duty to be sensitive towards the child as the [PERSON]. A.865/2019 courtroom proceedings are alien to him and it may have a more stressful and terrifying effect which may create a fear in his mind rendering him unable to speak about the incident. It is for the court to adjudge the grasping abilities of children, their tendency to fantasise and their susceptibility to coaching, which are certain factors that need careful examination on case to case basis. Therefore, the court must be satisfied that the attendant circumstances do not show that the child was acting under the influence of someone or was under a threat or coercion. Careful evaluation of the evidence of a child witness in the background of facts of each case in context of other evidence on record is inescapable before the court decides to rely upon it., are thus germane and relevant in the facts and circumstances of the instant case. [CARDINAL]. It is essential to observe that in the instant case the minor child witness is not a mere witness but is the victim herself and in such circumstances, it is apparent that her testimony is a vivid account of whatever took place with her. The verdict of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in Nivrutti [PERSON] [PERSON] and [ORG]. Vs. State of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] SC [DATE] categorically observes to the effect- [CARDINAL]. The facts and circumstances of the instant case clearly point out that the minor child victim C examined as PW-3 was picked up by the accused i.e. the appellant herein and was taken into the bushes wherein, he had taken off his underwear and taken off the childs [PERSON]. A.865/2019 underwear and the accused i.e. the appellant herein inserted his penis into her vagina, as a consequence of which she bled profusely and on the child having screamed and shouted, he left and ran away. In the circumstances, the commission of kidnapping of the minor child by the accused i.e. the appellant herein from outside her house at X from the local guardianship of her parents and of having taken her to the Jhuggis of the area Y with intent that she may be compelled for illicit intercourse and of the appellant thereby thereafter having committed aggravated penetrative sexual assault upon the minor child aged [DATE] [DATE] at the time of the offence as established by exhibitPW4/ B i.e. the birth certificate of the minor child giving [DATE] [DATE] of birth to be [DATE] under[ [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], [DATE] punishable thus under[ SECTION_UNK] of the POCSO Act, [DATE], stands established beyond a reasonable doubt. [CARDINAL]. As regards the contention that had been raised on behalf of the prosecutrix that Ms. Z mentioned in the statement of the mother of the prosecutrix i.e. the counselor had not been cited as a witness nor examined by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], it is essential to observe that as answered vide the CRL.REF. no.2/2016 in response to question [ORG], which reads to the effect [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] or the JJ Act do not contemplate any report to be made by a counsellor. It further makes it explicitly clear that counselling report notes of the counsellor as well as any person or expert recognized under [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] and [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] are confidential in nature and the same can not be made a part of the chargesheet or otherwise on the trial court record., it is thus apparent that the counseling report notes of the counselor are confidential in nature and can not be made a part of the charge sheet or otherwise in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] Record and thus, in these circumstances, the non production of the counselor as a prosecution witness does not detract from the veracity of the prosecution version. [CARDINAL]. In the facts and circumstances of the instant case, the records bring forth that the learned [ORG] [ORG] has carefully scrutinized the entire available record to arrive at the conclusion in believing the testimony of the minor prosecutrix and there is no reason not to believe her testimony that the appellant herein was the sole perpetrator of the commission of the crime. [CARDINAL]. In view thereof, it is apparent that there is no merit in the appeal, in as much as the testimony of all the prosecution witnesses, are consistent and cogent in relation to all material particulars. [CARDINAL]. In the circumstances, the conviction of the appellant for the proved commission of the offences punishable under[ SECTION] and[ SECTION_UNK] of the POCSO Act, [DATE] is [PERSON]. A.865/2019 established and the appellant has been rightly so convicted by the learned [ORG] [ORG] vide judgment dated [DATE]. [CARDINAL]. The learned [ORG] [ORG] taking into account the age of the appellant being [DATE] [DATE], with the responsibility of an old aged mother and previous clean antecedents has apparently already taken a lenient view by imposition of only a sentence of [ORG] [ORG] for a period of [DATE] [DATE] and to pay a fine of [DATE] and in default of the payment of the fine to further undergo [ORG] [ORG] for a period of [DATE] [DATE]. Thus, in the facts and circumstances of the instant case, there is no ground for variance of the sentence imposed vide the impugned order on sentence dated 23.03.2019 also. [CARDINAL]. However, in terms of the verdict of [ORG] [ORG] in Phul Singh Vs. State of [GPE] in Criminal Appeal no. 506/1979 decided on [DATE] and directions laid down by us in Sanjay vs State 2017 III AD Delhi [CARDINAL] dated 20.02.2017 so that the carceral period reforms the convict as also reiterated by this Court in [PERSON] [PERSON] vs [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] no.456/2017, [ORG] [PERSON] vs State Crl.

[CARDINAL]. The concerned Superintendent at [FAC] [FAC] [FAC], [GPE] [GPE] where the appellant shall be incarcerated for the remainder of the term [PERSON].

      " [CARDINAL]. This Regular Second Appeal under[ SECTION] 1908 impugns the Judgment of the First Appellate Court dated 26.9.2014. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] vide its [PRODUCT] dated 26.9.2014 has decreed the suit by setting aside [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] dated [CARDINAL] which had dismissed the suit. The subject suit was a suit for possession, mesne profits and injunction with respect to the suit property admeasuring [CARDINAL] sq. yards bearing no. A-699, [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], [GPE], situated in khasra no. 409/274. [ORG] no. 206/2015 2. The case of the respondent plaintiff was that he purchased ownership rights in the suit property by usual documentation being the Agreement to Sell, [ORG] [ORG] of Attorney, Will, [NORP], etc dated [DATE]. Out of [CARDINAL] sq. yards, [CARDINAL] sq. yards were purchased by the respondent plaintiff from [ORG]. Gyanwati and [CARDINAL] sq. yards each were purchased from Sh. Prabhu Dayal and Sh. Rakesh Kashyap. The appellant defendant is alleged to have trespassed illegally and taken possession of [CARDINAL] shop and [CARDINAL] rooms in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] shop being the area which was purchased from Smt. Gyanwati and [CARDINAL] rooms being the area purchased from Sh. Prabhu Dayal. [ORDINAL] a legal notice was sent to the appellant defendant in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] which led to sitting of a [ORG] whereby the appellant defendant was to handover possession which he failed to do so, and therefore, after serving [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] on 8.2.2007 the subject suit was filed. [CARDINAL]. The defence of the appellant defendant was that the suit property was not owned by the respondent plaintiff because the suit property was acquired by the government by [PERSON] [PERSON]. [DATE] and [DATE] and possession was also taken by the government. The acquisition proceedings and the possession proceedings were of [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Accordingly, it was prayed that since the respondent plaintiff was not the owner the suit should be dismissed. [ORG] no. 206/2015 4. After the pleadings were complete, the trial court on 21.2.2009 framed the following issues- 5. Before the trial court the respondent plaintiff proved the entire chain of documentation i.e from his sellers, namely, [ORG]. Gyanwati, Sh. Prabhu Dayal and Sh. Rakesh [PERSON] and also from the predecessors in- interest of [ORG]. Gyanwati, Sh. Prabhu Dayal and Sh. Rakesh Kashyap. These documents have been proved and exhibited and is so noted accordingly in paragraph [CARDINAL] of the judgment of the trial court and which reads as under- [CARDINAL]. Appellant defendant also led evidence of acquisition and possession proceedings qua the Government and which evidence is referred to in paragraph [CARDINAL] of the judgment of the trial court and the same reads as under- [CARDINAL]. Trial court dismissed the suit holding that since the suit land is proved to have been acquired by the government, and which acquisition and possession proceedings are of [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], therefore the respondent plaintiff by his documents of [DATE] could not claim title to the suit property. Accordingly, the suit for possession was dismissed. [CARDINAL]. The [ORDINAL] appellate court by an elaborate, exhaustive, thorough and well reasoned judgment has set aside the judgment of the trial court and held that even if the respondent plaintiff failed to show his title because the suit land [ORG] no. [CARDINAL] was acquired by the Government, respondent plaintiff proved his possessory title to the suit property and therefore he was entitled to succeed on the basis of the possessory title as against the world at large except the true owner, and that respondent plaintiff could succeed against the appellant defendant as the appellant defendant was not the true owner. Ordinarily, I would have given detailed reasoning to uphold the judgment of the [ORDINAL] appellate court, but, in my opinion, since the [ORDINAL] appellate court has passed a very exhaustive and thorough judgment, and possibly even I can not do any better so far as language is concerned, I seek to reproduce relevant paragraphs being paragraph [PERSON]. [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] of the judgment of the [ORDINAL] appellate court, and which read as under- [CARDINAL]. I completely agree with the discussion, reasoning and conclusion of the [ORDINAL] appellate court because [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW], [DATE], [DATE] provides that there is a period of [DATE] [DATE] for filing of a suit on the basis of possessory title.[ SECTION] and can be filed within [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] of dispossession. It is not in dispute that the subject suit has been filed [ORG] no. [CARDINAL] within [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] of dispossession of the respondent plaintiff claiming possessory title and therefore the [ORDINAL] appellate court was completely justified in decreeing the suit on the basis of prior possessory title of the respondent plaintiff and because appellant defendant failed to prove any ownership title or possessory title of the suit property as against the respondent plaintiff. I also note that the [ORDINAL] appellate court has exhaustively referred to various documents which were proved by the respondent plaintiff being the chain of title documents of respondent plaintiff from the previous persons who claim ownership and therefore possessory title with respect to the suit property. These documents were exhibited as [PERSON] to [ORG] before the trial court. In paragraph [CARDINAL] of its judgment, the [ORDINAL] appellate court has further referred to LPG gas connection obtained by respondent plaintiff on 21.1.1998 vide [ORG], electricity connection in [DATE] as per the documents exhibitPW1/28 to exhibitPW1/33, water connection in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] as per documents exhibitPW1/34 and exhibitPW1/35 as also filing of income tax returns since [DATE], [DATE] vide exhibitPW1/45 and the property tax payment receipt exhibitPW1/38. All these documents refer to the address of the suit property being that of the respondent plaintiff and therefore showing possession of the respondent plaintiff of the suit property. [ORG] no. 206/2015 10. The only way in which respondent plaintiff could have been dislodged was by the appellant defendant showing possessory title prior to [DATE], but on this aspect the appellant defendant miserably failed and which is rightly held in paragraphs [CARDINAL] and 20 of the judgment of the [ORDINAL] appellate court, which are reproduced above. The [ORDINAL] appellate court rightly notes that except a simple self serving statement no documentary evidence or any other credible evidence was led by the appellant defendant with respect to his possession being a prior possession before [DATE] when the respondent plaintiff acquired, if not ownership title, but at least possessory title of the suit property. [CARDINAL]. The [ORDINAL] appellate court has noted in paragraph [CARDINAL] of its judgment the peculiarity which prevails in [GPE] that various colonies have come up on government land, and such colonies running into [CARDINAL] have been regularized by government, and that the suit land is situated in [CARDINAL] such unauthorized colony which is in the process of being regularized by government. In any case, dehors regularization aspect the only person who can claim possession from the respondent plaintiff would be the government on the basis of ownership but not appellant defendant who has no title and not even prior possessory title than the respondent plaintiff. [CARDINAL]. Learned counsel for the appellant defendant has sought to place reliance upon the judgment titled as [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and Others Vs. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] no. [CARDINAL] op. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and [ORG], [DATE] 1 SCALE 126 to argue that in a suit for declaration of title and possession, title has to be clearly proved to succeed for possession, however, this judgment has no application in the facts of the present case because the [ORDINAL] appellate court has not proceeded to grant relief to the respondent plaintiff on the basis of ownership title but has granted reliefs on the basis of possessory title of the respondent plaintiff being better than the illegal possession and occupation of the appellant defendant as against the respondent plaintiff. [CARDINAL]. In view of the above, there is no merit in this [ORDINAL] appeal. No substantial question of law arises. Since the appellant defendant has illegally dispossessed the respondent plaintiff and which respondent plaintiff has been forced to incur costs of litigation till this [ORDINAL] appeal, this Regular Second Appeal is dismissed with costs of rs.25,000/-. Costs shall be paid by the appellant defendant to the respondent plaintiff within [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] from [DATE].\n",

      " [CARDINAL]. Issue notice. Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON], [ORG] accepts notice on behalf of the respondent. Counsel for the respondent waives his right to file a reply to the petition and submits that the petition can be heard on the basis of the record that has been filed with the petition. [CARDINAL]. Counsel for the respondent submits that having checked the records, he does not deny that [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] was served on the petitioner only on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Accordingly, the present petition would be within the period of limitation as provided under[ SECTION_UNK] of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], [DATE], [DATE]. [CARDINAL]. This petition under[ SECTION], [DATE], has been filed by the petitioner challenging OMPCOMM 87/2018 page [CARDINAL] the Arbitral Award dated [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] passed by the [ORG] [ORG] awarding certain claims in favour of the respondent along with interest. [CARDINAL]. The disputes between the parties arose out of the failure of the petitioner to complete the work of construction of dwelling units including allied services for Officers, JCOs OR RRC Line, [ORG] [ORG], [GPE], Hasting Line, [PERSON] at [PERSON] awarded by the respondent in favour of the petitioner vide Agreement dated [CARDINAL]. The petitioner having delayed the completion of the work, the agreement was terminated by the respondent on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Upon such termination of the agreement, the respondent proceeded to award the balance work to [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] at the risk and cost of the petitioner on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. [CARDINAL]. The respondent raised the following claims before the Arbitrator 78. Revised Amount of Claim no.1. The Claimant vide letter no. [DATE]/ MAP PH-11/ PKG-19/1 B ARB/72/ [CARDINAL] dated [CARDINAL] Jun [CARDINAL] submitted revised amount of Claim no. 1 as under [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] amount rs.54,67,59,241.52- ii Encashment of Performance Guarantee rs.3,24,50,000.00 iii [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] rs.13,134.00- iv [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] Staff Engr rs.71,33,067.00- v [PERSON] in submission of [ORG] [ORG] rs.16,96,000.00- vi Expenditure on preparation of Final [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] CILQ Charges rs.11,44,96,200.00- TOTAL rs.63,76,57,642.52- OMPCOMM 87/2018 page [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL]. The petitioner was proceeded ex parte by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] as it failed to appear before the Arbitrator in spite of several notices. [CARDINAL]. The [ORDINAL] contention raised by the counsel for the petitioner is that at the inception of the arbitration proceedings, the petitioner had challenged the authority of the Sole Arbitrator to proceed with the arbitration as the Arbitrator was an officer of the respondent [ORG] [ORG]. She submits that in terms of[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act, the Arbitrator is mandated to decide on such objection [ORDINAL] before proceeding with the arbitration. She submits that in the present case, the Arbitrator did not decide the objection raised by the petitioner during the arbitration proceedings, but decided the same only with [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. She submits that this itself is a ground for setting aside [FAC] [FAC] [FAC]. [CARDINAL]. On the other hand, counsel for the respondent draws my attention to the summary of various proceedings before the Arbitrator as recorded in [FAC] [FAC] [FAC] itself. He submits that the petitioner was playing hide and seek with the Arbitrator inasmuch as it appeared once and then thereafter chose not to appear. He further submits that the objection raised by the petitioner was vague in nature and, in fact, contrary to Clause 60 of the General Conditions of Contract by which the petitioner had given its consent to appointment of a serving officer as an Arbitrator for adjudicating the disputes between the parties. He submits and it is denied by the counsel for the petitioner that as the arbitration proceedings had commenced prior to coming into force of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] OMPCOMM 87/2018 page [QUANTITY] [QUANTITY] [QUANTITY], [DATE], the law as prevailing then would be applicable. He submits that prior to the amendment of the Act, even a serving officer could be appointed as an Arbitrator, provided he had not dealt with the subject matter of the dispute. He submits that the petitioner never raised any objection on this ground and in fact, the Arbitrator, in paragraph [CARDINAL] of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], has categorically recorded that he had no interest in the dispute nor had he dealt with the case earlier in his official Code of Civil Procedure, [DATE] [DATE] ity before entering upon the reference of the dispute. [CARDINAL]. I have considered the submissions made by the counsels for the parties. Though it is correct that the Arbitrator should decide on the objection raised by the party to the dispute with respect to his authority, before proceeding further with the arbitration proceedings, however, in the present case, it is seen that the challenge to the authority of the Arbitrator was only on the ground that he is a serving officer of the respondent [ORG] [ORG] and as such is ineligible to continue as an Arbitrator. It is also noticed that prior to the appointment of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] who has passed [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], another Arbitrator had been appointed by the respondent. Similar objection to such appointment had been taken by the petitioner, however, the said [ORG] had also proceeded with the proceedings before resigning from his position as an Arbitrator on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. The present [PERSON] was appointed by the respondent on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and he gave his consent to such appointment on [DATE] [DATE], [DATE] calling upon the parties to file their respective pleadings. The petitioner raised an objection against his OMPCOMM 87/2018 page [CARDINAL] appointment vide letter dated [ORDINAL] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], however, forwarded their memo of appearance on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] to the Arbitrator. Thereafter, on the statement of claim being filed by the respondent, the petitioner also sought a direction from [ORG] [ORG] for the respondent to supply a number of documents listed in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. Such direction was issued by the Arbitrator on [CARDINAL] th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Thereafter, though the petitioner did not appear before the Arbitrator, it again sent an authorization in favour of [CARDINAL] Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON], Director of the petitioner to appear before the Arbitrator. It also made a request for supply of further documents vide letter dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] so as to enable it to proceed further in the arbitration proceedings. Finally, in its letter dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], the petitioner again raised an objection about the authority of the Arbitrator to act as such as he was an ex employee with [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. Though, this letter is not on record, the [ORG] has reproduced some portion of the same in paragraph [CARDINAL] of the Impugned Award. The letter had stated that the petitioner would be challenging the authority of the Arbitrator before an appropriate [PRODUCT]. On being asked whether any petition challenging the authority of the Arbitrator to proceed with the arbitration proceedings had been filed by the petitioner in any [ORG] or otherwise, counsel for the petitioner submits that no such proceedings were filed by the petitioner. As noted above, the petitioner also chose to remain absent from the arbitration proceedings without any justified cause. [CARDINAL]. In view of the above, merely because the Arbitrator did not pass OMPCOMM 87/2018 page [CARDINAL] a formal order rejecting the challenge made by the petitioner to his authority to continue as an Arbitrator, it can not be said that he committed an illegality which would vitiate the arbitration proceedings making [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] liable to be set aside in these proceedings on that ground alone. I may only reiterate that the law as prevailing prior to the amendment to the Act was that even a serving officer can act as an Arbitrator provided he has not dealt with the subject matter of the dispute. In [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] vs [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] 2009 8 SCC 520, [ORG] [ORG] reiterated the then prevailing law on this issue as under- [CARDINAL]. No party can say he will be bound by [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] part of the agreement and not the other part, unless such other part is impossible of performance or is void being contrary to the provisions of the Act, and such part is severable from the remaining part of the agreement. The arbitration clause is a package which may provide for what disputes are arbitrable, at what stage the disputes are arbitrable, who should be the arbitrator, what should be the venue, what law would govern the parties, etc. A party to the contract can not claim the benefit OMPCOMM 87/2018 page [CARDINAL] of arbitration under the arbitration clause, but ignore the appointment procedure relating to the named arbitrator contained in the arbitration clause. [CARDINAL]. It is now well settled by a series of decisions of this [ORG] that arbitration agreements in government contracts providing that an employee of the Department usually a high official unconnected with the work or the contract will be the arbitrator, are neither void nor unenforceable. [ORG] [CARDINAL]. We find no bar under the new Act, for an arbitration agreement providing for an employee of a Government statutory corporation public sector undertaking which is a party to the contract, acting as an arbitrator.[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act requires the Chief Justice or his designate, in appointing an arbitrator, to have due regard to [CARDINAL].[ SECTION_UNK] requires an arbitrator, when approached in connection with his possible appointment, to disclose in writing any circumstances likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to his independence or impartiality.[ SECTION_UNK] enables the arbitrator being challenged if i the circumstances give rise to justifiable doubts as to his independence or impartiality, or ii he does not possess the qualifications agreed to by the parties. [CARDINAL].[ SECTION_UNK] requires the arbitrator to treat the parties with equality that is to say without bias and give each party full opportunity to present his case. Nothing in[ SECTION_UNK], [CARDINAL], [DATE] or other provision of the [ORG] suggests that any provision in an arbitration agreement, naming the arbitrator will be invalid if OMPCOMM 87/2018 page [CARDINAL] such named arbitrator is an employee of [CARDINAL] of the parties to the arbitration agreement. [CARDINAL]. Sub [LAW] [LAW] of[ SECTION_UNK] provides that parties are free to agree upon a procedure for appointment of arbitrators. Sub [LAW] [LAW] provides that where a party fails to act, as required under the procedure prescribed, the Chief Justice or his designate can take necessary measures. Sub [LAW] [LAW] gives the discretion to the Chief Justice his designate to choose an arbitrator suited to meet the requirements of a particular case. The said power is in no way intended to nullify a specific term of arbitration agreement naming a particular person as arbitrator. The power under sub [LAW] [LAW] is intended to be used keeping in view the terms of the arbitration agreement. [CARDINAL]. The fact that the named arbitrator is an employee of [CARDINAL] of the parties is not ipso facto a ground to raise a presumption of bias or partiality or lack of independence on his particle There can however be a justifiable apprehension about the independence or impartiality of an employee arbitrator, if such person was the controlling or dealing authority in regard to the subject contract or if he is a direct subordinate as contrasted from an officer of an inferior rank in some other Department to the officer whose decision is the subject matter of the dispute. [CARDINAL]. Where however the named arbitrator though a senior officer of the Government statutory body government company, had nothing to do with the execution of the subject contract, there can be no justification for anyone doubting his independence or impartiality, in the absence of any specific evidence. Therefore, senior officers usually [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] or equivalent of a Government statutory corporation public sector undertaking, not associated with the contract, are considered to be independent and impartial and are not barred from functioning as arbitrators merely because their employer is a party to the contract. [ORG] [ORG] page [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL]. The position may be different where the person named as the arbitrator is an employee of a company or body or individual other than the [ORG] and its instrumentalities. For example, if the Director of a private company which is a party to the arbitration agreement, is named as the arbitrator there may be a valid and reasonable apprehension of bias in view of his position and interest, and he may be unsuitable to act as an arbitrator in an arbitration involving his company. If any circumstance exists to create a reasonable apprehension about the impartiality or independence of the agreed or named arbitrator, then the court has the discretion not to appoint such a person. [CARDINAL]. Subject to the said clarifications, we hold that a person being an employee of [CARDINAL] of the parties which is the [ORG] or its instrumentality can not per se be a bar to his acting as an arbitrator. Accordingly, the answer to the [ORDINAL] question is that the learned Chief Justice was not justified in his assumption of bias. [CARDINAL]. On being asked if the petitioner had any knowledge of the Arbitrator having dealt with the subject matter of the dispute, the counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner has no such knowledge. On the other hand, there is a categorical denial by [ORG] [ORG] as recorded in paragraph [CARDINAL] of the Impugned Award on this aspect. Therefore, I find no merit in the objection raised by the petitioner on this ground. [CARDINAL]. The [ORDINAL] contention raised by the counsel for the petitioner is that the arbitrator has awarded the amounts in favour of the respondent without seeking any proof of the same. She submits that though the agreement between the parties empowered the respondent to complete the work at the risk and consequence of the petitioner, the [ORG] [ORG] page [CARDINAL] Arbitrator should have scrutinized the terms of the agreement between the respondent and [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] to find out and determine whether any additional work had been granted in favour of the new contractor and as to whether the work awarded in favour of the new contractor was indeed the balance work that had remained to be executed by the petitioner. Counsel for the petitioner further submits that there were various other documents that were relevant for the purposes of adjudicating the claim of the respondent, however, they find no mention in [FAC] [FAC] [FAC]. These documents should also have been considered by the Arbitrator before passing [FAC] [FAC] [FAC]. [CARDINAL]. I am unable to agree with the submission made by the counsel for the petitioner. [ORG] [ORG] in the Impugned Award records that the respondent has filed before it the agreement between the respondent and the petitioner as also the contract awarded in favour of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] As the petitioner had remained ex parte before the Arbitrator and even a response to the Statement of Claim had not been filed by it, there was no dispute before the Arbitrator that the agreement as awarded in favour of the new contractor is not for the balance work that had remained unexecuted by the petitioner. In absence of such a dispute being raised, it was not for the Arbitrator to have himself assumed such a dispute and to scrutinize the evidence as if to find loopholes in the same or to conduct a fishing and roving enquiry. Once the respondent had made a submission that the agreement executed by it with the new contractor was for the balance work and such assertion remained OMPCOMM 87/2018 page [CARDINAL] unchallenged, the Arbitrator was entitled to pass an award on the basis of this submission, especially when the [CARDINAL] contracts had been duly proved before the Arbitrator. [CARDINAL]. It is further contended by the counsel for the petitioner that in the present case, there is a duplication of amounts awarded in favour of the respondent by the Arbitrator. She submits that on the one hand, the Arbitrator has awarded compensation [CARDINAL] of the agreement amount equalling to rs.6,48,77,451.99 while adjudicating Claim no.1a as [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART], at the same time, the Arbitrator had also awarded an amount of rs.11,44,96,200/- in favour of the respondent as damages on the ground that the respondent had suffered this loss due to failure of the petitioner to timely complete the project of construction of the flats. [CARDINAL]. Counsel for the respondent, on the other hand, submits that the [CARDINAL] claims are distinct and, therefore, there is no question of any duplication of the amounts awarded in favour of the respondent. [CARDINAL]. As far as this objection is concerned, I agree with the counsel for the petitioner. The damages in form of Cash in lieu of Quarter CILQ have been awarded in favour of the respondent under claim no. 1j for the period of delay in schedule date completion of the flats in the agreement with the petitioner and the schedule date of completion in the contract with the new contractor, that is for the period [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] 6th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. This, therefore, is clearly the actual damages suffered by the respondent due to delay in completion of the work. On the other hand, while granting claim no.1a, an amount of rs.6,48,77,451.99 has also been OMPCOMM 87/2018 page [CARDINAL] awarded in favour of the respondent as liquidated damages. [CARDINAL].[ SECTION] provides as under- [CARDINAL]. It is to be noted that claim made under claim no.1j was the amount paid by the respondent to its officers who are not allotted Government accommodation. It was the claim of the respondent that due to delay in construction of the flats in question, it had to continue paying the [ORG] to its officers [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] that is the original date of completion of the work and [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] that is the stipulated date of completion of the work as mentioned in the contract with the subsequent contractor. This clearly was, therefore, damage suffered by the respondent, however, as the contract between the petitioner and the respondent provided for liquidated damages, the respondent could not have been held entitled to any amount in excess of the same and in any case not in addition to the same and the Award of claim no. 1j can not be sustained. [CARDINAL]. It is further contented by the counsel for the petitioner that the Arbitrator has wrongly awarded damages for the delay in submission of Critical Part Method CPM charticle She submits that as the amount awarded is in form of liquidated damages penalty, the same could not have been awarded without proof of actual loss suffered by the respondent due to such delay. I am unable to agree with the said submission. Clause 3.11.2 of the agreement provides that any delay on part of the contractor to submit the CPM Network Diagram shall attract a penalty as provided therein. Before the Arbitrator, there was no dispute raised with respect to such delay in submitting [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. Nor was an objection raised that the amount OMPCOMM 87/2018 page [CARDINAL] mentioned in clause 3.1.2 is in form of penalty and not liquidated damages or is unreasonable. In absence of such assertions, the Arbitrator has rightly awarded the said amount in favour of the respondent. I place reliance on the judgment in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] supra. I, therefore, find no merit in the objection against the award of the amount in favour of the respondent under [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON]. It is lastly contended by the counsel for the petitioner that the amounts awarded in favour of the respondent being in form of damages, interest prior to the date of the award could not have been granted in favour of the respondent. This submission of the petitioner can not be accepted as the Arbitrator has clearly recorded cogent reasons for award of such interest and from the dates that he has awarded such interest in favour of the respondent. I may only quote from paragraphs [CARDINAL] and 104 of the Impugned Award as under a Pendent elite Interest. The Claimant has claimed an interest of [CARDINAL] per annum on an amount of rs. 55,74,80,379.92 amount of original claim no. 1 of [ORG] [ORG], from the date of intimation to Respondent to deposit the money up to date of award. I find that the Claimant vide their letter dated [CARDINAL] [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] had intimated to the Respondent to deposit the risk and cost amount The Claimant had asked for deposition of an amount of rs.37,70,00,000.00 and stated that this is an approximate amount and that the exact amount of recovery shall be known after completion of risk and cost contract. In view of the various submissions of the [ORG], my findings above, case laws relied upon as also the revised claim [ORG]. I direct the Respondent to pay simple interest [CARDINAL] per annum on the amount of rs.37,70,00,000.00 from [CARDINAL] Sep 2014 to [CARDINAL] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] prior to date of my appointment and simple interest [CARDINAL] per annum on the amount awarded against revised claim no.1 i.e. rs.63,65,81,178.32 from [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] of my appointment to the date of this award, in favour of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. I allow a time of [DATE] [DATE] to the Respondent, to pay to the Claimant the amounts set out as awards by me in favour of the. Claimant, failing which, the [ORG] [ORG] page [CARDINAL] Respondent shall also pay to the [ORG], simple interest [CARDINAL] per annum on these amounts for the period to be reckoned from [DATE] [DATE] after the date of this award to the date on which the actual payment is made. [CARDINAL]. I, therefore, find no merit in the said objection of the petitioner. [CARDINAL]. In view of the above, the present petition is allowed only to the limited extent of setting aside the award of Claim no.1j in favour of the respondent and the consequential interest thereon, while upholding the remaining amounts awarded in [FAC] [FAC] [FAC] in favour of the respondent. There shall be no order as to costs.\n",

Whether the judgment should be reported in [FAC] [FAC] [FAC] [FAC], [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT]. This appeal is directed against the order dated 03.07.2009 passed by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in relation to [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. [CARDINAL]. The Assessing Officer had made an addition of Rs 42,60,000/- as unexplained income of the assessee under[ SECTION_UNK] of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW], [DATE]. The said sum had been received from [CARDINAL] different companies by way of share application money. [CARDINAL]. The Commissioner of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] as well as [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] had deleted the addition after following the ITA 378/2010 decisions of this [ORG] in CIT v. [PERSON] [PERSON] and Finance Limited 2007 [CARDINAL] Taxman 440 Del and CIT v. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [CARDINAL]. The [ORG] observed that the assessee in the present case has furnished all the evidence that was expected of it. The share applicants had been identified and evidence in the form of share application as well as the balance sheet revealed such investment in the shares of the assessee company. This, according to [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], established that the shares were applied for by these companies and the shares were also allotted on the basis of these applications. [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] We may also observe that the Commissioner of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] noted that the summons had been issued to the share applicants and had been responded to by sending replies along with supporting evidence except in a few cases. In those cases where there was no response to the summons, it had been ascertained that the company existed in the record of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. The Commissioner of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] also observed that the share application form, share allotment letter and the bank statement clearly established the identity of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], which was [CARDINAL] of the entities which did not respond to the summons issued by the Assessing Officer. Even the principal officer of the said company, Mr [PERSON] [PERSON] attended the proceedings before the Investigation Wing of the department. In respect of another such company, that is, [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], identical facts were noted. Another party, namely, [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] 378/2010 had also not responded to the summons issued but had subsequently sent a confirmation, proof of allotment and bank statement as well as the share application form. Consequently, the Commissioner of Income Tax Appeals came to the conclusion that the identity of all the share applicants stood established. It is in these circumstances that [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] confirmed the decision of the Commissioner of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. We also find no infirmity in such conclusions arrived at by the lower authorities. In any event, these are findings of fact and no perversity has been pointed out by the learned counsel for the appellant. No substantial question of law arises for our consideration.

      " 15.02.2016 1. By this common judgment, we shall dispose of [CARDINAL] petitions assailing a common verdict dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] passed by the respondent no.3- Commandant, [ORG] against the petitioners dismissing them from service and inflicting a punishment of [DATE] [DATE] on them. For the sake of convenience, the facts of W.P.C 9853/2005 are being referred to. [CARDINAL]. Cut to bone, facts of the case are that in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], the petitioner W.P.C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] W.P.C [DATE] was appointed to the post of a constable in the respondent [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and in due course, he was promoted to the rank of [ORG] [ORG]. On [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], when the petitioner was posted at [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] at [GPE] in [GPE] [GPE], he had headed an ambush party and along with the other petitioners in [DATE] [DATE] and [DATE] [DATE], was deputed in [GPE] area of river [GPE]. At [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME], the ambush party observed that [CARDINAL] boats loaded with contraband goods were coming towards the ambush point. These boats were coming from [PERSON] [PERSON] side and they were headed towards [GPE]. The ambush party seized both the boats, which were full of contraband medicines and cattle. [CARDINAL]. It is the respondents version that the owner of the contraband goods that were lying in the boats had entered into a deal with the members of the [ORG] ambush party, namely the [CARDINAL] petitioners herein, and the ambush party had agreed to release the seized boats for a sum of rs.1,40,000/-. However, the owner of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] i.e. the smuggler was able to arrange a sum of rs.80,000/- and resultantly, the ambush party released [CARDINAL] boat on [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] and confiscated the other boat. Later on, the ambush party had also seized another boat loaded with [CARDINAL] cattle. A [ORDINAL] party informed the Commandant Head about the seizure of the [CARDINAL] boats, one loaded with contraband medicines and the other loaded with cattle. [CARDINAL]. In the meantime, the [ORG] [ORG] received telephonic information from another civilian that the ambush party had allowed [CARDINAL] boat to sail towards [GPE] by accepting a bribe amount of rs.80,000/-, which was still in their possession. The said information was received by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], who immediately apprised the Company W.P.C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] W.P.C 10204/2005 Commandant of the same. Both, the Company Commandant and Head Constable G Bhika Ram went to the ambush point and on checking the ambush party, recovered a sum of rs.79,000/- from a lungi lying in the boat. Later on, a sum of rs.2,000/- was recovered from Sharif Hussain, who was the boatman of the ambush party and had stated in his testimony that he had sold [CARDINAL] cattle from the herd of the seized cattle, which was handed over to him by the ambush party. The said amount was also deposited in the government treasury. [CARDINAL]. After the aforesaid incident, vide order dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], a [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] was conducted and all the [CARDINAL] petitioners were found blame worthy. Based on [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] of 24th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], the petitioners were heard for the offences under[ SECTION_UNK] 46 of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW], [DATE], in terms of Rule 45 of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW]. All the petitioners pleaded guilty to the charges levelled against them at the pre trial stage. Subsequently, the respondent no.3- Commandant ordered for preparation of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. On [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], Record of Evidence was prepared and five witnesses were examined on oath in the presence of the petitioners. Out of the [CARDINAL] witnesses, PW-1 was Commandant [PERSON] [PERSON], who had stated that he had received a telephonic call from an unknown civilian about the ambush party accepting bribe of rs.80,000/-. PW-2 was Head Constable G Bikha Ram, who had accompanied PW-1 to the spot and conducted a search on the boat of the ambush party and recovered the bundle of notes. [ORG] was [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], who was performing the duty of [PERSON] [PERSON] on the date of the incident and had briefed the ambush party before they had left the camp. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], was engaged as a boat man by W.P.C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] W.P.C [DATE] the [ORG] and at the time of the incident and was in the boat with the ambush party. PW-5, Krishna Mandal was also working as a boat man with [ORG] and had taken PW-1 PW-2 in his boat to the spot for confronting the ambush party. [CARDINAL]. The [CARDINAL] petitioners were afforded an opportunity to cross examine all the [CARDINAL] prosecution witnesses. The statement of said witnesses were read over to the petitioners in the native language but none of them were cross examined except for [PERSON], who was cross examined by the petitioner, [PERSON] [PERSON] in [DATE] [DATE]. It is a different matter that the cross examination of the said witness did not elicit anything in favour of the petitioners. The records produced by the respondents reveal that all the [CARDINAL] petitioners did not affix their signatures on the [ORG] proceedings. [CARDINAL]. After completion of the [ORG] proceedings on [CARDINAL] th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], the petitioner and the other [CARDINAL] co accused were again heard by the respondent [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], who informed them that the case would be taken up before [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in short SSFC on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. On [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], the petitioners were handed over copies of the [ORG] proceedings and the charge sheets against receipt and thereafter they were tried before the [ORG]. All the [CARDINAL] petitioners had pleaded guilty to the charges levelled against them and the procedure prescribed under Rule 142 2 of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] was followed. The petitioners also made statements under [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] for seeking mitigation of punishment. After considering the material on record, the petitioners were awarded a sentence of dismissal from service with [DATE] [DATE] in civil jail. [CARDINAL]. Aggrieved by the dismissal orders, the petitioners had filed statutory W.P.C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] W.P.C [DATE] petitions before the Director General, [ORG], which were rejected vide order dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. [CARDINAL]. Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON], learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the respondents had falsely claimed that the petitioners had pleaded guilty, which can be verified from the fact that the documents recording the plea of the petitioners admitting to their guilt, do not bear their signatures. He states that when the petitioners had allegedly pleaded guilty, the respondents ought not to have simply accepted it and instead, they should have proceeded with the trial in terms of [ORG] [ORG] 143 4 a of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. He argues that there was no evidence to indict the petitioners particularly when neither the smugglers from whom money was allegedly taken nor the civilians who had informed the respondents about the incident, were named or examined by the respondents. It is contended that no independent witness was associated at the time of seizure of the contraband goods and no seizure memo was prepared when an amount of rs.80,000/- was allegedly recovered from the petitioners and mere recovery of money is not sufficient to sustain the charge levelled against them. In support of his submission that it is unbelievable that the petitioners had pleaded guilty before the [ORG], particularly when the documents recording their plea of guilt were not signed by the petitioners, learned counsel for the petitioners relies upon a judgment dated [ORDINAL] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], pronounced by a Division Bench of this Court in [DATE] [DATE], entitled [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. Union of [GPE]. [CARDINAL]. Per contra, learned counsel for the respondents refutes the arguments advanced by the other side and states that the proceedings before the [ORG] commenced only after the plea of guilt by the petitioners and that too, after complying with the provisions of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of BSF Rules. She denies the W.P.C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] W.P.C [DATE] contention of the counsel for the petitioners that the petitioners had not been explained the meaning of the charge or that they had not understood the nature of the charge levelled against them. She submits that the provisions of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] were duly complied with, both in letter and spirit, which can be gauged from the fact that the petitioners were afforded an opportunity to choose a defending officer, whom they had selected on their own. Further, the petitioners had participated in the pre trial proceedings, which included [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] proceedings, the offence report, hearing on charge and the recording of evidence. Lastly, learned counsel submits that the petitioners had all the opportunity to cross examine the prosecution witnesses, but they had declined to do so and further, they did not comply with the provisions of Rule [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] of the BSF Rules, which gives them an opportunity to offer their version and make a statement. [CARDINAL]. To fortify the said submission, learned counsel for the respondents relies upon the Record of Proceedings dated 24th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] conducted before the [ORG] under Rule 45 of the Rules, wherein it was recorded that the petitioners had declined to cross examine the witnesses or step forward as a witness. To fortify her argument that merely because the petitioners had not signed the plea of guilt, could not be a ground for interfering in the impugned order, she referred to a judgment dated [CARDINAL] th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] in [DATE] [DATE], entitled exhibit [PRODUCT]. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON]. UOI ors. and clarified that the said judgment was pronounced after passing of the judgment in the case of [ORG] [ORG] supra, cited by the counsel for the petitioner. [CARDINAL]. We have heard the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for the parties and carefully examined the records produced by the counsel for the W.P.C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] W.P.C [DATE] respondents, in the light of the decisions cited by both sides. [CARDINAL]. A glance at the prosecution evidence recorded at the pre trial stage is considered necessary, as it throws some light not only on the sequence of events that had taken place on the date of the incident i.e. on [CARDINAL] th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], but also on the complicity of the petitioners. [CARDINAL]. PW-2, [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], who had accompanied the Commandant to the ambush boat had deposed as below After counting of rs. Sh. [PERSON] [PERSON], [ORG] inquired from W.P.C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] W.P.C [DATE] HC [PERSON] [PERSON] that he has information that ambush party has sold some cattle also. Then HC [PERSON] [PERSON] gave rs.2000/- [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] rupees to Sh. [PERSON] [PERSON], [ORG] and told that we sold [CARDINAL] cattle to give money to the [PERSON] of the boat. [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] rupees were also included in the recovered rupees. By this total 81900 eighty one thousand nine hundred rupees were seized recovered from ambush party accordingly seizure memo of seized rupees was prepared. [CARDINAL]. PW-3,CT [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON], who had also accompanied the Commandant to the spot, had deposed as follows W.P.C [DATE] W.P.C [DATE] [DATE]. Following is the testimony of [ORG] [ORG], the boatman who had accompanied the ambush party During the negotiation all ambush party were present. At [TIME] [TIME] hrs after receiving 80,000/- rupees ambush party allowed one loaded boat with medicine and cloth to go into [GPE] and W.P.C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] W.P.C [DATE] seized [CARDINAL] boat and above seized boat remain near to our boat. About boat was also loaded with cloths and medicines. When party was discussing to leave seized boat after taking money I told them not to do this act but they stopped me and told we are responsible for our act you need not to worry. In [TIME] at [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] hrs [CARDINAL] boat loaded with cattle going towards [GPE] from [GPE] was seized by ambush party with the help of my boat in which [ORG] party laid ambush that boat was without engine in said boat [CARDINAL] number cattle were loaded. After the seizure of above cattle and boat I asked ambush party to give me [CARDINAL] cattle as I did hard work for making the seizure of boat loaded with goods and boat loaded with cattle. Then ambush party gave me [CARDINAL] cattle I sold above cattle to fisherman in rs.2000/- in night only. In [TIME] at about 0400 hrs ambush party gave [PERSON] report to [ORG] [ORG] and told operator that they have seized [CARDINAL] boat loaded with goods and [CARDINAL] boat with cattle, they asked boat for shifting goods. At [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] hrs [CARDINAL] boat from BOP [GPE] came to our ambush point. At [TIME] [TIME] hrs HCG Bhika Ram came to ambush point place of seizure [PERSON] [PERSON] was standing in our boat. After [TIME] [TIME] Sh. [PERSON] [PERSON], [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] also reached to the seizure site. After that HC G Bhika Ram and Sh H S Randhawa, [ORG] called the ambush members and had some discussion. After approx [TIME] [TIME], Sh. H S [GPE], [ORG], HC G Bhika Ram and ambush party came to the boat in which ambush was laid. HC G Bhika Ram inquired about the money then HC [PERSON] [PERSON] gave money to HC G Bhika Ram, which was wrapped in the lungi of HC Nand Ram and was kept under the bedding and bedding was kept near to engine of said boat. After taking above money which was wrapped in lungi Sh. H S [ORG], [ORG] and HCG Bhika Ram left that place and told us to bring the seized goods to [ORG] [ORG]. Then we brought the seized goods to [EVENT] [EVENT] with the help of boat. W.P.C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] At about 0930 hrs when we reached to BOP Nimtita HC [PERSON] [PERSON] asked me to give [ORG] which was received after______ of [CARDINAL] cattle among the seized [CARDINAL] cattle. I hand over the 2000/- rupees to HC Nand Ram then further detail what happen I do not know. [CARDINAL]. The records reveal that an opportunity was granted to all the petitioners to cross examine the prosecution witnesses, but they had declined to do so. Further, during the proceedings of plea of guilt, each of the petitioners were called upon to make a statement with reference to the charge levelled against them or offer circumstances for mitigation of punishment. [PERSON] [PERSON], the petitioner in [DATE] [DATE] had stated as below- [CARDINAL]. [PERSON] [PERSON], the petitioner in [DATE] [DATE] had requested that he be given a minimum punishment, as his parents, brother, sister and family were dependent on him. Rajesh [PERSON] [PERSON], the petitioner in [DATE] [DATE] had stated that such a mistake will not be repeated in the future. [CARDINAL]. After recording their statements, the proceedings before the [ORG] were conducted on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], wherein it was recorded that all the petitioners had pleaded guilty. It was also recorded that they were conveyed the effect of their plea of guilt, as prescribed under the provisions of Rule 142 of the Rules. Finally came the verdict of the [ORG] whereunder all the [CARDINAL] petitioners were inflicted a sentence of dismissal from service with [CARDINAL] W.P.C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] W.P.C [DATE] [DATE] in civil jail. [CARDINAL]. The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners that the record demonstrates that none of the petitioners had signed the plea of guilt, which should be understood to mean that they had in fact not pleaded guilty and in such circumstances, the respondents ought to have proceeded with the trial in terms of Rules [CARDINAL] 143 4 a of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], is found to be absolutely untenable in the light of the extensive incriminating evidence recorded during the pre trial stage, and reproduced above. [ORG] placed on the decision in the case of [ORG] [ORG] supra, would also not be of much assistance to the petitioners for the reason that in the said case, the court was of the opinion that there was fabrication of documents and no rationale explanation was furnished by the respondents therein as to how the proceedings of an earlier date were given on a subsequent page, when the record was maintained in an ascending order. Giving the facts of the said case, the [ORG] had concluded that the petitioners therein had not pleaded guilty and resultantly, the entire SSFC proceedings were declared as vitiated. [CARDINAL]. In the present case, there is a clear distinction inasmuch as in the light of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, who included amongst others, [PERSON], the boat man, who was a civilian engaged by the respondents and had narrated the sequence of events that had unfolded on [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME], it can not be contended by the petitioners that there was no evidence on record to indict them, particularly when recovery of a substantial amount of rs.80,000/- was made on the spot. Though the petitioners had all the opportunity to explain how such a large amount had come in their possession, they had elected not to do so. Quite obviously, the petitioners had nothing at all to say in defence and that is why they pleaded W.P.C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] W.P.C [DATE] guilty. [CARDINAL]. In the case of Kalu Ram supra, referred to by learned counsel for the respondents, the petitioner therein had pleaded guilty to the charges framed against him and was subsequently convicted by the [ORG], which sentence was assailed on the ground that the plea of guilt allegedly taken by him, stood vitiated for the reason that the documents containing the plea of guilt did not bear his signatures. After taking into consideration several decisions on the aspect of plea of guilt, including the judgment relied upon by the petitioners herein in the case of [ORG] [ORG] supra, [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] had held as follows- [CARDINAL]. In the decisions reported as [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] Singh v [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [PERSON] [PERSON] and Subhash Chander v Union of [GPE] [PERSON] [PERSON] the plea of guilt taken by the petitioners therein was held to be vitiated as the document containing the plea of guilt of the petitioners did not bear the signatures of the petitioners. On the other hand in the decisions reported as [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of India 110 2004 [ORG] [PRODUCT] and [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] MANU DE/1823/2001 it was held that plea of guilt taken by the petitioner therein can not be held to be vitiated on the ground that the document containing the plea of guilt of the petitioners does not bear the signatures of the W.P.C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] W.P.C [DATE] petitioners when there is no specific legal requirement to obtain signatures of a charged officer on the plea of guilt taken by him. [CARDINAL]. In view of the above legal position, it can not be universally laid down that the plea of guilt taken by a charged officer would stand vitiated in every case where the document containing the plea of guilt of the charged officer does not bear the signatures of the charged officer. What would be the effect of non bearing of signatures of the charged officer in document containing the plea of guilt by him on the veracity of the plea of guilt taken by him depends on facts and circumstances of each case. [CARDINAL]. In the instant case it could well be argued that the over whelming evidence emerged against the petitioner in the Record of Evidence. Despite being given an opportunity the petitioner did not rebut the evidence appearing against him inasmuch as the petitioner did not cross examine any of the witness of the prosecution. The petitioner did not make any statement before the Recording Officer in terms of the provisions of Rule 483 of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] to explain the evidence appearing against him. The silence of the petitioner in the Record of Evidence proceedings is a very strong pointer to the fact that the petitioner had nothing to say in his defence. That being the position, it is a good possible argument that the petitioner had no alternative but to plead guilty at the trial. [ORG] added [CARDINAL]. Even in the instant case, it has clearly emerged that the petitioners were afforded an opportunity to cross examine the prosecution witnesses but they did not cross examine any of them, except for [PRODUCT], from whom they were unable to elicit anything material, which would have gone in their favour. Further, the petitioners did not make any statement in defence, though an opportunity was granted to them. Having failed to rebut the W.P.C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] W.P.C [DATE] evidence produced against them and having failed to cross examine the material witnesses and further, having declined to make any statement before the Recording Officer in terms of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of the BSF Rules, it has to be concluded that the records maintained by the respondents are quite in order and the petitioners can not be permitted to renege from the plea of guilt, recorded by the respondents in the course of the [ORG] proceedings. Nor can the petitioners claim that the proceedings stood vitiated because their signatures were not obtained on the plea of guilt. The attending facts and circumstances noted above including the overwhelming evidence stacked by the prosecution are found to be sufficient to indict all the [CARDINAL] petitioners. [CARDINAL]. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we are of the opinion that the petitioners have not been able to point out any illegality, perversity or arbitrariness in the proceedings held or the punishment inflicted against them for seeking judicial review. Accordingly, all the [CARDINAL] petitions are dismissed as being devoid of merits and the parties are left to bear their own costs.

Accused Uttam Kumar used to give tuitions to his son Vibhor at his residence. On 19.04.1999 at around 09.30 P.M. the deceased and her mother returned to the house after shopping. At that time Uttam Kumar was teaching [GPE] in [GPE]. [ORG] 747/2007 a room on the [ORDINAL] floor of the house. After keeping the things purchased by her in the house the deceased went to the room where the accused was teaching [GPE]. When the deceased entered [ORG] room, [GPE] went to the kitchen to drink water. Thereafter he i.e. Anil Garg along with [GPE] went to the room where the accused was teaching [GPE]. When he i.e. Anil Garg did not find the accused in the room he made inquiries from [GPE] about the whereabouts of the accused upon which [GPE] told him that the accused might be present in the bathroom attached to the said room. Thereafter he inquired about the deceased as she was nowhere to be seen in the house. When he and his family members could not find the deceased anywhere in the house a doubt arose in his mind that perhaps the accused may have locked the deceased and himself in the bathroom. The door of the bathroom was knocked and the accused responded and on being asked to open the door, the accused replied Since you are marrying the deceased with some other boy I have murdered her and that I would not open the door. Thereafter he informed the police about the aforesaid incident. [CARDINAL]. The statement exhibitPW-2/ A on which the endorsement exhibitPW-16/ A was made by Inspector [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] was forwarded at [TIME] [TIME] on 20.04.1999 through Const. [PERSON] [PERSON]. [ORG] 747/2007 [PERSON] [PERSON], to the police station for registration of an FIR where HC [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT], registered [ORG] [ORG], [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT] [PRODUCT]. As recorded in the endorsement exhibitPW-16/ A, the appellant was apprehended at the spot. In fact, if the contents of the endorsement exhibitPW-16/ A are correct, the accused was caught red handed. Inspector [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] PW-18, seized the knife recovered from the possession of the accused vide memo exhibitPW-2/4 as also prepared the sketch exhibitPW-2/3 of the said knife.

It may be noted that the seizure memo exhibitPW-2/5 records that [CARDINAL] buttons of the shirt worn by the accused when he was apprehended were found to be broken. Inspector [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] prepared the site plan exhibitPW-18/1 of the house in question recording therein at points [ORG] and [ORG] the spots where the body of the deceased was lying and the accused was found standing in the bathroom respectively. [CARDINAL]. In the meantime, SI Ashok Kumar PW-11, [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], and [PRODUCT]. [PERSON] [PERSON], a photographer, reached the spot on being summoned. SI [PERSON] [PERSON] inspected the spot and prepared his report [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] report [EVENT] [EVENT]/ A records that [CARDINAL] chance prints were found on a Crl.

It may be noted here that one photograph could not be developed. The photographs [PRODUCT] and exhibitPW-12/13 depict the door from within the bathroom which opens into the bedroom. [CARDINAL]. The body was seized and sent to the mortuary, where on [DATE], at about 11.35 [ORG] Dr. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON], conducted the post mortem and prepared the report exhibitPW- [CARDINAL]. Following external injuries were found on the person of the deceased as recorded in the post mortem report [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE].

[CARDINAL]. The knife recovered from the possession of the accused at the time of his arrest was also sent to the mortuary along with the body of the deceased for purposes of obtaining opinion of the doctor regarding the weapon of offence. Dr. [PERSON] [PERSON] PW-9 examined the said knife and gave his opinion [ORG] which inter alia records that the Crl. [ORG] 747/2007 injuries [ORG] and [CARDINAL] found on the person of the deceased could have been caused by the said knife. The opinion [ORG] has been penned at the rear page of the post mortem report on which the sketch of the knife has also been drawn by Dr. [PERSON] [PERSON]. [CARDINAL]. After conducting the post mortem, Dr. [PERSON] [PERSON] handed over the blood sample of the deceased on a gauze and the clothes of the deceased to [PRODUCT].

Statements of family members of the deceased present in the house were recorded, all of whom inculpated the appellant. [CARDINAL]. Armed with the aforesaid materials, the police filed a charge sheet against the accused. [CARDINAL]. In a nutshell, the case set up by the prosecution against the appellant was that the appellant who was the tutor of the deceased and her brothers developed a liking for the deceased. When the appellant learnt that the deceased is getting married he got enraged and murdered the Crl. [ORG] 747/2007 deceased by indiscriminately stabbing her in the bathroom in her house. [CARDINAL]. Before proceeding to note the evidence led at the trial, it is most important to note certain facts which were pressed into aid by learned counsel for the [ORG] to show, as per the [ORG], the crafty mind of the appellant. [CARDINAL]. During the trial, the appellant filed an application dated 06.09.2005 under[ SECTION]. praying that the official record maintained at [FAC] [FAC] pertaining to the meetings held between the jail inmates and the visitors between the period 21.04.1999 to 09.05.2000 be summoned. Along with the said application, written arguments were also filed by the appellant detailing the reasons for summoning the said record. It may be noted here that the application dated 06.09.2005 is at page [DATE] of the trial court record whereas the arguments filed by the appellant in support of the said application are at page [CARDINAL] of the trial court record. It may further be noted that the said [CARDINAL] documents are not drafted by the counsel of the appellant but are penned by the appellant himself in his own hand. [CARDINAL]. It is significant to note that the written arguments filed by the appellant in support of the application dated 06.09.2005 records that between the period 21.04.1999 to 09.05.2000 [CARDINAL] [PERSON] [PERSON], the lover of the deceased, [GPE]. [ORG] 747/2007 accompanied by his [CARDINAL] friends named [PERSON] and Suresh visited him in [GPE] [GPE]. During the said visits, [PERSON] told him that on 19.04.1999 he met the deceased in a market.

[PERSON] handed over the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 written by the deceased to him. [CARDINAL]. Relevant would it be to note that the order dated 03.12.2005 passed by the learned [ORG] [ORG] records that the jail meeting record sought to be summoned by the accused has been weeded out by the jail authorities. [CARDINAL]. At this juncture, it would be appropriate to note the contents of the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 referred by the accused in the afore noted written arguments filed by him.

[CARDINAL]. The letter exhibitDW-5/ PA is addressed to the mother of the deceased i.e. [ORG] [ORG]. The said letter records that [CARDINAL] under trials got various reliefs from the courts due to the written arguments prepared by him i.e. the appellant. Relevant would it be to note the following portion of the letter [DATE]/ PA- [CARDINAL]. The letter exhibitDW-5/ PB is addressed to the parents of the deceased, namely [PERSON] [PERSON] and [ORG] [ORG]. The relevant portion of the letter exhibitDW-5/ PB reads as under- [CARDINAL].

On being questioned about the relations between the deceased and the accused, he stated [ORG] We had no reason to have suspicion of any kind of relation between the accused and the Priyanka and it is correct that accused used to treat Priyanka as his daughter.

A suggestion was given to him that Anil Garg gave money to him in the presence of the appellant for the purposes of false implication of the appellant in the present case. No suggestion was given to him that M.R.Singhal was present at the spot. [CARDINAL]. Vibhor Garg PW-19, the brother of the deceased, also deposed on the lines of the statement exhibitPW-2/ A of Anil Garg. Additionally, he deposed that the police had seized the knife recovered from the possession of the appellant in his presence. On being questioned about the time of the occurrence, he stated [ORG] It is correct that I have stated in my examination in- chief that the occurrence took place at [TIME] [TIME] on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Confronted with statement recorded [ORG] [ORG] [CARDINAL] on [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] in which the witness had stated about the occurrence at [TIME] [TIME] on [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME]. On being confronted with the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to [ORG] he denied that the said letters were written by his sister. The suggestions pertaining to false implication of the appellant which were put to Anil Garg were also put to him and the same were categorically denied by him. Crl. [ORG] 747/2007 [DATE]. It is significant to note here that save and except giving general suggestions pertaining to the false implication of the appellant and that the appellant used to give tuition to [GPE] at [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] during [DATE] [DATE] of the murder of the deceased, [GPE] has not been subjected to any cross examination with respect to essential portion of his testimony and in particular his statement that the appellant was giving him tuition in the night at [TIME] [TIME] [TIME]. [DATE]. In his examination under[ SECTION]. the appellant denied everything and pleaded false implication. The defence put forward by the appellant was that he was teaching the deceased and her brothers Varun and [GPE] since [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and that he used to treat them as his own children. He had helped the father of the deceased i.e. [PERSON] [PERSON] when an income tax raid was conducted at his house and also when he got involved in connection with a case registered under [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], [DATE]. He had extremely close relations with the family of the deceased. On [CARDINAL] occasion the deceased told him that she was having an affair with a boy named [PERSON] [PERSON] upon which he advised her to disclose the said fact to her parents. He further claimed that the deceased told him that she had married [PERSON]. He claimed that on 19.04.1999 the deceased [PERSON]. [ORG] 747/2007 met [PERSON] in the market and that the said fact came to the knowledge of her family. On [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] 19.04.1999 between 05.00 [GPE] to [CARDINAL] P.M. he was present in the house of the deceased to give tuitions to [GPE] and thereafter he returned to his house. He claimed that at about 09.30 P.M. the security guard of the family of the deceased came to his house and told him that father of the deceased has called him to his house, upon which he went to the house of the deceased. On reaching there, the father of the deceased told him that he and his son Vibhor had murdered the deceased in a fit of fury as she refused to end her relationship with [PERSON] and marry the boy of their choice. The father of the deceased asked him to take blame for the murder of the deceased and that when he refused to oblige him he got angry and pushed him inside the bathroom where the deceased was lying dead and closed the door of the bathroom from outside. With the help of [ORG] [ORG], [ORG] and the [ORG] of the area, the family of the deceased got him falsely implicated in the present case. While he was lodged in jail, [PERSON] accompanied by some persons came to meet him and handed over the letters exhibitDA to [NORP] written by the deceased to [GPE]. [DATE]. In support of his defence, besides examining himself, the appellant examined [CARDINAL] witnesses. Crl. [ORG] 747/2007 [CARDINAL]. The appellant examined himself as DW-5. In his testimony, the appellant reiterated the defence taken by him in his examination under[ SECTION]. Additionally, he deposed that he used to give tuitions to the children of the brother of the deceased namely [ORG] and [GPE] and many other children of the relatives of the family of the deceased. Mr. [PERSON] Ram Singhal who was the M.L.A. of Adarsh Nagar constituency was the maternal uncle of the father of the deceased. [DATE] [DATE] prior to the incident, [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] requested him to teach the children of his household but he declined to do so because of shortage of time. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] also requested him to help him in the elections held in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] but he refused to do so. Due to the said [CARDINAL] reasons, [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] was annoyed with him. At the time when he reached the house of the deceased on being called by her father, besides the parents and brothers of the deceased, other family members of the deceased namely [ORG] [ORG], [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], Satish Garg, Sunil Garg, [PERSON] [PERSON], [PERSON] [PERSON], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE], [GPE] and [LOC] were present there. Besides the aforesaid family members, servants employed at the residence of the deceased namely [GPE], [PERSON] [PERSON], Raju and Hari were also present there. When he was lodged in jail, [PERSON] [PERSON] along with his [CARDINAL] friends Raj and [GPE] [GPE]. [ORG] 747/2007 visited him and told him that on 19.04.1999 he i.e. [PERSON] had met the deceased in the market. When the mother of the deceased saw the deceased in his company, she got very annoyed and forcibly dragged the deceased from the market. After sometime [PERSON] received a telephonic call from a servant employed at the house of the deceased who told him that the family members of the deceased had killed the deceased when she refused to end her affair with [PERSON]. [PERSON] assured him that he would help him in getting acquitted in the present case but since [DATE] [DATE] he has not heard a word from [PERSON]. He apprehends that [PERSON] has been kidnapped or murdered by the family of the deceased. The police falsely implicated him in the present case at the instance of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. On 19.04.1999 he witnessed [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] handing over bundle of notes to Inspector [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] at the residence of the deceased. The door of the bathroom which was bolted from outside was opened by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. When he was lodged in jail, he was forced to write letters addressed to family members of the deceased. [CARDINAL]. On being confronted with the letters exhibitDW-5/ PA and exhibitDW-5/ PB the appellant admitted that the same were written by him. Crl. [ORG] 747/2007 [DATE]. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON], the elder brother of the appellant, deposed that the appellant used to go to the house of the father of the deceased to teach his children. On 19.04.1999 he saw that a servant employed at the house of the deceased told the accused that the father of the deceased had called him immediately to his house upon which the appellant left for the house of the deceased. In [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] of 20.04.1999 he left [GPE] in connection with his business. When he returned to [GPE] after [DATE] [DATE] he came to know that the appellant has been implicated in a murder case. The relations between him and the appellant were strained. On being questioned about the servant who had come to call the appellant, he stated [ORG] I never accompanied [PERSON] [PERSON] to the house of Anil Garg nor I ever separately visited that house. The person who had come to call accused [PERSON] [PERSON] at earlier also came to call [PERSON] [PERSON] on [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] occasions to go to his house. [CARDINAL]. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON], [ORG] [ORG], [GPE] [GPE] college, produced the admission form exhibitPW- 2/ A of the deceased and deposed that the said form is required to be filled by the student in his her own handwriting. [CARDINAL]. Marianus Jojo DW-3 deposed that in response to the summons issued by the [ORG] to the Principal of Mont Fort Crl. [ORG] 747/2007 [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], he was directed to submit the letter exhibitDW-3/ A which was signed by the [ORG]. It appears that the appellant had wanted production of some record pertaining to the deceased from the said school, which was not available with the school. [CARDINAL]. Dr. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON], Senior Scientific Officer, [ORG] deposed that she had compared handwritings contained in the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 with the admitting handwriting of the deceased and that the handwriting contained in the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and exhibitDW-4/13 is that of the deceased. [CARDINAL]. Holding the fact that the appellant was found standing in the bathroom where the deceased was found dead with a knife in his hand when the door of the said bathroom was broken coupled with the fact that the prosecution has been able to establish that the appellant had a motive to murder the deceased, for there was evidence on record to show that the appellant had a lust for the deceased and that he could not fathom that the deceased was getting married to someone else, vide impugned judgment and order dated 07.03.2007 the learned Trial Judge has convicted the appellant of having committed the murder of the deceased. In coming to the conclusion that the appellant had a lust for the deceased, the learned Trial Judge has held that the fact [PERSON]. [ORG] 747/2007 that the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 were produced by the appellant and that his explanation as to how he came into possession of the said letters was unsatisfactory, for the appellant failed to establish the existence of [PERSON] [PERSON] and the fact claimed by him that [PERSON] [PERSON] handed over the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 to him, leads to a conclusion that [PERSON] [PERSON] is no one else but the appellant himself. The learned Trial Judge rejected the defence taken by the appellant on the ground that it is highly improbable that the father and brother of the deceased would have murdered the deceased in such a brutal and gruesome manner. Vide order dated [DATE], the learned Trial Judge had sentenced the appellant to undergo imprisonment for life and pay fine in sum of rs.5,00,000/- in default to undergo simple imprisonment for a period of [DATE] [DATE] for committing the offence punishable under[ SECTION]. Conscious of the fact that life convicts are entitled to be considered for premature release after serving an actual sentence of [DATE] [DATE], the learned Trial Judge has held that as and when the issue of premature release of the appellant is to be considered by the [ORG], the brutality of the murder and the pollution of the pious relationship between the teacher and the taught be brought to the notice of the Board. It is apparent that the purport of [GPE]. [ORG] 747/2007 the order of sentence is that the appellant should remain for the entire life in jail and not be released premature. [CARDINAL]. Conscious of the fact that the appellant has transposed his defence into the citadel of the prosecution i.e. by claiming entrapment, the appellant has ostensibly tried to get away to explain his presence in the house when the police came and his fingerprint being detected inside the bathroom where the dead body of deceased was recovered. The central issue, on which the debate has to take place, is whether the defence of entrapment has to succeed or the witnesses of the prosecution have to be believed. [CARDINAL]. At the hearing of the appeal filed by the appellant, following arguments were advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant A [ORDINAL], unlike the burden upon the prosecution to prove the guilt, the accused has only to probablize the defence. In the backdrop of the above legal position, learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there are several discrepancies in the case of the prosecution which strongly probablize the defence of the appellant that he was entrapped. i With reference to the seizure memo exhibitPW-2/5 which records that the shirt worn by the appellant which was seized when he was arrested was minus [CARDINAL] buttons, learned counsel urged that from said fact it could [PERSON]. A.no.433/2007 747/2007 be gathered that a scuffle had taken place during which [CARDINAL] buttons of the shirt of the appellant broke and fell down. No attempt being made to recover the broken buttons was a deliberate act of [PERSON]. [PERSON] for the reason if the buttons were found outside the bathroom it would have established a scuffle outside the bathroom which would be as per the claim of the appellant that when he was summoned to the house, the father and the brother of the deceased requested him to own up for the crime and take money and when he refused, they pushed him inside the bathroom where the dead body of the deceased was lying. ii [ORDINAL], with reference to the testimony of the police officers namely [PRODUCT]. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON], Const. [PERSON] [PERSON] PW-14, Const. Mukesh PW-15, [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and Inspector [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON], as also the family members of the deceased namely [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON], [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and Vibhor Garg PW-19 it was urged that all of them claimed that the door of the bathroom was broken into. If this be so, learned counsel urged that it was unexplainable that neither the broken door nor the broken bolt was seized. Referring to the photographs [PRODUCT] and exhibitPW-12/13 which depicted the door of the bathroom from inside the bathroom, learned counsel pointed out that the door as also the latch bolt was intact. Therefrom, [PERSON]. A.no.433/2007 747/2007 counsel urged, an inference could be drawn that the door was locked from outside as claimed by the appellant after he was pushed inside and when the police came, the outside lock was removed and the appellant was apprehended after being entrapped. iii [ORDINAL], it was submitted that there was a mismatch between the shirt and the vest pertaining to the place where the [CARDINAL] were stained with blood. It was urged that most of the stains on the vest were at places where corresponding staining of the shirt was not to be seen. Thus, it was a case of deliberately plating stains on the shirt and the vest of the appellant. iv [ORDINAL], it was urged that the opinion [NORP] was obtained from Dr. [PERSON] [PERSON] under duress, who admittedly gave opinion [ORG] at the [ORDINAL] instance only with reference to injury [ORG] and 2 and opined that the [CARDINAL] could be caused by the knife in question. For the reason, the other [CARDINAL] injuries were not possibly caused by the knife in question, Dr. [PERSON] [PERSON] deliberately did not give, on being so pressurized, any opinion. Surprisingly, while giving the opinion [PERSON] Dr. [PERSON] [PERSON] opined without even looking to the knife. Further, injury no.8 which was sickle shaped could not be caused by the knife in question. It was submitted that it was apparent that [CARDINAL] weapons were used and this probablized the defence that the father and the brother of the deceased [PERSON]. [ORG] 747/2007 inflicted the injuries on her. v [ORDINAL], it was urged that the father of the deceased admitted during cross examination that Satish Garg, his brother, resided on the ground floor. Counsel urged that in the peculiar facts of the instant case it was apparent that material witnesses were withheld. vi Lastly, on the issue it was urged that since the family members of the deceased knew that it was a case of entrapment and a local [ORG] was related to them, using political influence, a thoughtful plan was conceived of which could be evidenced by the fact that as against the normal practice of sending [CARDINAL] or three police officers when information is received about a crime being committed, in the instant case 6 police officers went to the spot for the obvious reason it was all pre planned. B The [ORDINAL] submission advanced by learned counsel for the appellant was that the conduct of the parents and brothers of the deceased at the time of the occurrence was most unnatural and that the same casts a serious doubt on the veracity of their evidence. The [ORDINAL] instance pointed out by the learned counsel was that [ORG] [ORG], deposed that the incident in question occurred at [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [PERSON] [PERSON] also drew attention of the court to the recording contained in the crime team report [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] that the time of occurrence was 9.30 [PERSON] [PERSON] drew attention of the Crl. A.no.433/2007 747/2007 court to the fact that the police was informed about the incident at [CARDINAL] P.M. as recorded in [GPE] entry, exhibitPW-4/1. Counsel submitted that the fact that the parents and brothers of the deceased took [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] to inform the police about the incident strongly suggests that they bought time to cook up a false story before informing the police. Taking the argument a little further, counsel pointed out that the fact that when the parents and brothers of the deceased knocked the door of the bathroom in question as claimed by them and the appellant informed them as claimed by them that he had murdered the deceased as they were getting her married to someone else, said fact should have found mention in [GPE] entry exhibitPW-4/1 and the absence thereof shows that the story cooked up by them is false. The [ORDINAL] instance of the alleged unnatural conduct pointed by the learned counsel was that Anil Garg PW-2 and [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], deposed that they did not make an attempt to break open the door of the bathroom where the deceased was locked and that there was a gap of [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] between the time when the factum of locking of the deceased in the bathroom came to their knowledge and the time of arrival of the police at the spot. According to the counsel, despite the fact that the parents and brothers of the deceased knew that the life of the deceased was in great Crl. [ORG] 747/2007 danger, for according to them the appellant had told them that he had murdered the deceased as they were getting her married to someone else, their conduct of not attempting to break open the door of the bathroom in question for a period of [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] and instead keep waiting for the police is most unnatural. The [ORDINAL] instance of the alleged unnatural conduct pointed out by the learned counsel was that the parents and brothers of the deceased did not lock the door of the bathroom in question from outside to prevent the appellant from escaping, for how would they know that the appellant would not try to break free. C The next submission advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant was that the case of the prosecution is marred by many improbabilities arising therein. The [ORDINAL] improbability pointed out by the learned counsel was that [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] injuries were found on the person of the deceased as recorded in the post mortem report exhibitPW-9/1. According to the counsel, had the appellant inflicted [CARDINAL] injuries on the person of the deceased, the deceased would have cried or shrieked and the same would have attracted the attention of her parents and brothers. However, as per the prosecution, they did not even hear a whisper of cry of the deceased and that they came to know about the incident in question when they looked for the deceased when they [PERSON]. A.no.433/2007 747/2007 could not find her anywhere in the house. The [ORDINAL] improbability pointed out by the counsel was that the weapon allegedly used by the appellant to murder the deceased was an ordinary kitchen knife. Counsel pointed out that the appellant could have picked up said knife only from the kitchen of the house. Counsel submitted that [GPE] PW- 19, deposed that when the deceased arrived in the room where he i.e. Vibhor was being taught by the appellant, he i.e. Vibhor went to the kitchen to drink water and that thereafter when he came back to the room he did not find the appellant there and noticed that the door of the bathroom attached to the room was locked. Counsel submitted that in such circumstances, Vibhor would have seen the appellant picking up from the kitchen the knife used to murder the deceased, which was not the position in the instant case. It was highlighted that it was just impossible for the appellant to have picked up the knife from the kitchen when Vibhor went to the kitchen and returned. It was submitted that the [CARDINAL] i.e. the appellant and [GPE] would have crossed each other and Vibhor not so deposing means that the knife was never with the appellant. The [ORDINAL] improbability pointed out by the learned counsel was that no tutor would teach a child at [CARDINAL] [LANGUAGE] in the night. Crl. [ORG] 747/2007 D The next submission advanced by the learned counsel for the appellant was that there are manifest errors in the impugned judgment. i The [ORDINAL] error pointed out by the learned counsel was that the learned Trial Judge has committed a patent illegality in holding that the circumstance that the appellant failed to prove that [PERSON] [PERSON] came to visit him in jail and that [PERSON] [PERSON] handed over the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 to him leads to a conclusion that the accused is [PERSON] [PERSON] and that the deceased had written the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to [ORG] to the appellant. According to the counsel, the only conclusion which could have resulted from the said set of circumstances was that the appellant failed to prove the existence of [PERSON] [PERSON]. In said regards, the learned counsel drew attention of the court to the fact that the parents and brothers of the deceased falsely denied that the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 do not contain the handwriting of the deceased. According to the counsel, had the appellant been [PERSON] [PERSON], the parents and brothers of the deceased would not have denied that the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to [ORG] were written by the deceased for the said fact would have gone a long way in proving the guilt of the appellant. Counsel submitted that the fact that the parents and brothers of the deceased denied that the Crl. [ORG] 747/2007 letters exhibitDW-4/1 to [ORG] were written by the deceased strongly suggests that the appellant was not [PERSON] [PERSON]. Counsel then drew the attention of the court to the following recording contained in the letters exhibit exhibitDW-4/1- 2 and exhibitDW-4/3- 5 respectively a [NORP] shall tell you many things which would prove that I forgot you completely over there, that I am wrong you will beat me, scold me b I used to start crying just as I started sending you kisses. Mamiji saw those tears, [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] According to the counsel, the aforesaid writings goes to show that [ORG], the brother of the deceased, and the maternal aunt of the deceased knew about the affair between the deceased and [PERSON] [PERSON]. Counsel submitted that had the appellant been [PERSON] [PERSON], the family of the deceased would have ended all their relations with the appellant the moment it came to their knowledge that the deceased is having an affair with the appellant. As a limb of the aforesaid submission, counsel further contended that the learned Trial Judge has committed an illegality in heavily relying upon the circumstance that the defence taken by the appellant was false, to infer the guilt of the accused. Counsel submitted that it is settled legal principle that the circumstance of a false defence taken by an accused is a circumstance which, after the chain of the circumstances appearing against an Crl. [ORG] 747/2007 accused is complete, can be added to the said chain to reinforce the guilt of the accused. In support of the said contention, the counsel relied upon the decision of [ORG] [ORG] reported as [ORG] Birdhichand [NORP] v State of Maharashtra AIR 1984 SC [DATE]. ii The [ORDINAL] error pointed out by the learned counsel for the accused was that the learned [ORG] [ORG] wrongly came to the conclusion that the appellant had a lust for the deceased, for there was no evidence on record which could support said conclusion. Learned counsel pointed out that none of the family members of the deceased deposed that the appellant had a lust for the deceased. On the contrary, Anil Garg PW-2 and [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], the father and brother of the deceased respectively, deposed that the appellant used to treat the deceased like his own daughter. [CARDINAL]. Keeping in view the defence taken by the appellant, in the instant case it would certainly be relevant whether the defence succeeds. The reason is obvious. The appellant has admitted his being arrested on being found inside the same bathroom in which the dead body of the deceased was found after the police reached the scene of the crime. Whereas the prosecution alleges that the appellant killed the deceased inside the bathroom and locked himself inside the Crl. [ORG] 747/2007 bathroom, the defence alleges that after the deceased was killed, the appellant was entrapped to come to the house and was pushed inside the bathroom and kept confined till the police arrived. [CARDINAL]. Suffice would it be to state that where a person is murdered at a spot and the accused is apprehended at the spot itself, the accused has to render an explanation as to how the deceased was killed and if not such explanation is rendered, the accused must admit the guilt. This is plain logic. The appellant has well understood the same and hence the defence of entrapment. [CARDINAL]. Thus, it can be safely be said that the instant case is akin to [CARDINAL] trains running on parallel lines and the diversions for the destination being towards the fag end of the journey and hence a close look at the competing claims of the prosecution and the defence. Instant case is not of a kind where the defence is of alibi and hence the principle of law that irrespective of the proof of [ORG], the prosecution has to prove its case of guilt beyond reasonable doubt being proved. [CARDINAL]. The most crucial aspect of the defence of the appellant is the mysterious [PERSON] [PERSON] to whom the deceased has written numerous letters, proved to be in the hand of the deceased by the testimony of [ORG]. [PERSON]. [ORG] 747/2007 [CARDINAL]. It is but apparent that the deceased was emotionally involved with somebody whom she referred to as [PERSON] and sometimes [ORG]. It is true that the parents of the deceased and her brother have denied the letters in question being written by the deceased, but the said denial has to be understood in the context of the traditional [NORP] society where premarital affair with a person of the opposite sex is considered as bad character and a dishonour to the reputation of the family. We read nothing more in the false denial by the family members of the deceased that the said letters were in the hand of the deceased. [CARDINAL]. Now, the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 could be with the appellant [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] circumstances. [CARDINAL], on being written and handed over by the deceased to the appellant or as claimed by the appellant when [PERSON] visited him in jail along with [CARDINAL] friends Raj and Suresh. [DATE]. As is to be noted from para 19 above, in his application filed under[ SECTION]., the appellant claimed that [PERSON] had met him in jail during visitors [TIME] on a date between 21.4.1999 to 9.5.2000 and hence prayer was made to summon the jail record containing record of visits made by visitors to the jail inmates during said period. [CARDINAL]. It appears to be very innocent, but is rooted, in our opinion in a wicked mind, that the said application was filed [PERSON]. [ORG] 747/2007 on 6.9.2005 when the appellant knew that the jail records have been weeded out. We say so for the reason in the letter exhibitDW-5/ PB written by the appellant to the parents of the deceased he has posted of his crafty skills by writing that he has created enough confusion and he is making a prayer to summon the jail record knowingfully well that the same has been weeded out. [CARDINAL]. The fact that the appellant had these letters with him from the very beginning is evidenced by the fact that he confronted Anil Garg PW-2 with these letters on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. The fact that nobody gave these letters to the appellant can be inferred from the fact that had they been so handed over to the appellant as claimed by him when Tinnu met him in the jail, the appellant would have immediately moved an application to preserve the jail record recording [LOC] visit to the jail. The appellant did not do so. We reiterate that the contents of the letter exhibitDW-5/ PB written by the appellant to the parents of the deceased are a reflection of his crafty mind. His claim that he was compelled and forced to write the letters exhibitDW-5/ PA and [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] is preposterous keeping in view the sublime language, richness of content and the phraseology of the [CARDINAL] letters which no jail inmate can compel another to write. The literary and the intellectual skill of the appellant is [PERSON]. [ORG] 747/2007 evidenced not only by the said [CARDINAL] letters but even from the well penned written arguments filed by the appellant in [ORG] in his own handwriting and the fact that those whom he taught as a private tutors got admissions in IITs and MBA Institutes of repute as claimed by the appellant himself. [CARDINAL]. Having held that the appellant failed to prove that a person named [PERSON] [PERSON] met the appellant in jail and handed over the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to [ORG], the question which arises is how come letters written by the deceased to [PERSON] [PERSON] came in possession of the appellant. [CARDINAL]. Was it that the appellant is none else but [PERSON] [PERSON] [CARDINAL]. The name of the appellant is [ORG]. Remove the letter U from [ORG] and one is left with ttam. Lovingly, it is easy to transform [GPE] to [GPE] and [GPE] to [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. The letters exhibitDW-5/ PA and [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] written by the appellant to the family members of the deceased also provide a clue regarding the identity of [PERSON] [PERSON]. [DATE]. The letter exhibitDW-5/ PA records that the mother of the deceased can collect letters written by the deceased, [CARDINAL] in number, from the appellant. The appellant only produced [CARDINAL] letters written by the deceased. What about the remaining [PERSON]. [ORG] 747/2007 [CARDINAL] letters Why did the appellant withhold remaining [CARDINAL] letters written by the deceased [DATE]. The letter exhibitDW-5/ PB written by the appellant to the parents of the deceased records that the deceased was the soul of the appellant. This is an expression used by lovers for each other. [CARDINAL]. Love songs and love letters are best comprehended only by the lovers. They carry scuttle messages and meanings. Code words and code language is used. The metaphors are intended to convey signals which only the opposite can receive and download. Unless assisted by linguistic and psychology experts it may be difficult for a [ORG] to fathom the real meaning of such letters. But, what is relevant for us is the fact that the deceased has expressed not only her love for [PERSON] but even the anguish that she would never be able to be his. [CARDINAL]. In paras [CARDINAL] to [CARDINAL] above, we have noted extracts of some of the letters written by the deceased to [PERSON] [PERSON] and they show that the deceased realized the mess in which she was. It shows that she was conscious of the fact that her relationship with [ORG] would just not be acceptable to anyone. [CARDINAL]. The young girl was a student of [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] undergoing her graduation course. As claimed by the Crl. [ORG] 747/2007 appellant and not denied by the family members of the young girl, the appellant had been her tutor for [DATE] together and thereafter for the younger siblings. The young girl was obviously besmitten by the intelligence of her tutor and so was the tutor. Whereas the young girl realized that she was helpless and hence allowed herself to be drifted, hoping that the currents would anchor her, the appellant acted coldly and with precision. [CARDINAL]. The post mortem of the deceased was conducted at about 11.35 A.M. on 20.04.1999 as recorded in the post mortem report [PERSON] of the deceased. The post mortem report [PERSON] records that the death of the deceased had taken place [TIME] [TIME] prior to the conduct of post mortem. Therefore, as per the post mortem report, the deceased died at [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] on [DATE]. It is a recognized fact that an error of plus or [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] could be taken in the instant case in fixing the time of death. In that view of the matter, it has to be taken that the deceased died any time [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] on [CARDINAL] to 01.35 A.M. on [CARDINAL]. [DATE]. The [DATE] diary entry exhibitPW-4/ A shows a call made at the police station at [DATE] in the night pertaining to the incident and thus we have empirical evidence wherefrom it can safely be said that the deceased was killed prior to [PERSON]. [ORG] 747/2007 [TIME] [TIME]. Thus, the probable time of death could be any time [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME]. It was urged that as per Vibhor and the other family members the crime took place at [TIME] [TIME], which is the time recorded as that of occurrence even in the rukka. Thus, there is empirical evidence of the crime being committed at [TIME] [TIME]. Submission made was that the family has taken [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] 50 minutes time to inform the police and this means that something was being brewed. Obviously, the suggestion was that what was being brewed was whom to entrap. [CARDINAL]. Now, the family members have deposed that the deceased returned to her house with her mother after shopping at [TIME] [TIME]. Thereafter, as deposed to by them, the various articles purchased during shopping were removed from the car and were kept inside a bedroom in the house. The shopping was not ordinary shopping and was not that of [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] or [CARDINAL] articles. The deceased was to get married shortly and the shopping was of her dowry articles. Nobody has spoken as to how many articles were purchased, but presumably they were many. Thus, time would be consumed to bring the purchases inside the bedroom. Nobody has said that the deceased immediately walked up to the room of [GPE]. Nobody has said that they looked at their watches to identify the time being [TIME] [TIME]. It is [PERSON]. A.no.433/2007 747/2007 apparent that as is usually to be noted in most cases, the time [TIME] [TIME] got fixed on rough estimates by all as time when the deceased returned home with the mother and not taking into account the time spent in removing the purchases from the car and bringing the same inside the bedroom and ignoring the fact that may be the deceased went after sometime to the room where [GPE] was taking tuition. Further, as deposed by the family members, when Vibhor and his father went to the room where [GPE] was taking tuition and saw neither appellant nor the deceased in the room, they thought that the appellant was in the bathroom and the deceased may have walked away. Only when the deceased was nowhere to be seen in the house and the appellant remained inside the bathroom, was the suspicion raised that something was amiss. Apparently, further time was consumed in this process, removing the said event further away from [TIME] [TIME]. But, freezing the time at [TIME] [TIME], everybody started talking of the crime being committed at [TIME] [TIME]. This got reflected even in the rukka dispatched from the house. [CARDINAL]. Thus, it would be useless to predicate an argument as if [TIME] [TIME] was the time when the crime was detected. [CARDINAL]. Returning to the time when the deceased returned home with her mother at [TIME] [TIME], and the same being a Crl. [ORG] 747/2007 simple estimation, well, the time of return could well be [TIME] [TIME] [TIME]. Giving time of [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] to unload the purchases from the car and bring them inside and further [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] time for the deceased and her mother to check that everything was brought inside and discounting sometime for the deceased to walk to the room where [GPE] was being taught by the appellant, discounting further time for [GPE] and his father searching for the deceased and then realizing that something was amiss in the appellant continuing to be in the toilet and then detecting as to what had happened, it is possible that by the time the crime was detected it was around [DATE] or [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME]. Thus, it is apparent that the crafty appellant is building a defence picking up a nut here and a bolt there. [CARDINAL]. If the defence of entrapment is considered, it would mean that the deceased was killed by her father and her brother out of anguish and frustration and having realized what they did, obviously an escape had to be found. The [CARDINAL] and the remaining family members put their heads together to think a way out. Could the body be disposed of If yes, how If not, why If not, what to do [NORP] help can we take Can we bribe somebody to accept the guilt If yes, who Would not all such alternatives being discussed [PERSON]. [ORG] 747/2007 require time We think it would. What would be the reasonable time Well, keeping in view that respectable persons had murdered their daughter, it would be troubled and puzzled minds minds under fear which would be thinking. These minds would have no focus, much less a logic. To arrive at a consensus, these troubled minds would not be expected to arrive at a solution within reasonable dispatch. [CARDINAL]. Now, assuming that these troubled minds arrived at a solution to falsely entrap somebody, it had to be further pondered over as to who should be ensnared. Various alternatives of ensnaring and the person to be ensnared had to be discussed. He had to be an easy target. Is it believable that these troubled minds would have contrived to design that let appellant be the victim. It is preposterous to so believe and accept. For this to have happened would mean that the family members of the deceased were cock sure that the appellant would be in his house and would immediately come on being summoned. What is the material before us that the family members were sure that the appellant was in his house and would immediately come on being summoned None. [DATE]. As per the appellant and even as per the parents of the deceased, the appellant was a man of their confidence and [PERSON]. [ORG] 747/2007 they believed that he treated their children as his own. It is difficult to believe that sharing such relationship of trust and confidence the family members of the deceased would strike a wicked plan to falsely entrap the appellant. [CARDINAL]. That leads us to another scenario. The police arrived in the house by [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] and admittedly the appellant was inside the bathroom with the dead body of the deceased inside. Though no witness has so stated and there is no evidence on record, but learned counsel for the appellant and the [ORG] informed us that the house where the appellant resided was at a distance of [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] drive from the house of the deceased. Thus, [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] would be consumed to make a visit to and fro from the house of the deceased to that of the appellant and back. Given the fact that the appellant would have spent a minimum of minute or [CARDINAL] in his house before embarking on his journey to reach the house of the deceased, on being summoned by her parents, [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] further time needs to be added while adding up the time to probablize what could have happened. That by [TIME] [TIME] information was passed on to the police means that the family members of the deceased had entrapped the appellant inside the bathroom in their house by [TIME] [TIME] and this means that the process of sending somebody to fetch the appellant had [PERSON]. [ORG] 747/2007 commenced by [TIME] [TIME] [TIME]. Going backwards, the process to think about all the alternatives and rule out the worst and pick on the best needs to be over within [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] [TIME] and under the circumstances we hold the same to be most impractical and unreasonably less for a conspiracy of the magnitude to be hatched. [CARDINAL]. Was it not easy for the family members to entrap any servant in the house Why pick on the appellant [DATE]. It is true that [PERSON]. [PERSON] PW-18 ought to have tried to ascertain as to what happened to the buttons on the shirt of the appellant which had broken. It would have been advisable to have searched for the buttons and picked them up. But, for a lapse committed by the investigating officer, it can not be said that a case otherwise proved should be thrown out. [CARDINAL]. Insofar as the argument that the photographs exhibitPW- [DATE] and exhibitPW-12/13 show the door of the bathroom in question in an intact condition and hence the claim of the family members of the deceased and the police officers that the door was broken into is false and this probablizes that the door was never locked from inside relevant would it be to note that Anil Garg PW-2 and [PRODUCT]. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] deposed that the bolt on the inner side of the door in question got broken when the police applied pressure to [PERSON]. A.no.433/2007 747/2007 break open the said door. Thus, the testimony of aforesaid witnesses clarifies the position that it was the bolt on the inner side of the door which got broken. As already noted herein above, there are [CARDINAL] photographs of the door in question being [CARDINAL] and exhibitPW-12/13. The photograph exhibitPW-12/13 shows the inner side of the door in question i.e. the position of the door when photographed while standing inside the bathroom, while the photograph [PRODUCT] shows the outer side of the door in question i.e. photographed while standing inside the bedroom. Therefore, it is the photograph [PRODUCT] which is relevant for the purposes of the present argument. The bolt is at the top of the door. [TIME] [TIME] look at the photograph [PRODUCT] shows that the bolt hole is present on the beading of the door. A bolt hole is affixed to the wooden frame on the side whereof the door is hinged. The photograph [PRODUCT] shows the bolt hole on the inner side of the door in question in a dislodged condition. What appears to have happened is that when the door was pushed from outside the bolt hole gave way as the screws which had secured the same to the frame gave way and the bolt hole remained embracing the bolt and when the door was shut, along with the bolt, the bolt hole came back to the same position where it originally was, creating an elusion of it [PERSON]. [ORG] 747/2007 being at the same place. Now, this could not have happened for the obvious reason where the bolt is moved upwards to secure it inside the bolt hole, it is only then that a door gets locked. If the bolt was secured inside the bolt hole on the door in the side of the bathroom, nobody could have entered inside as the door would not have opened. [CARDINAL]. We wonder as to what is the factual basis for the argument that there is mismatch at the place where the vest of the appellant which was seized when he was arrested got stained with blood vis a- vis the shirt. There is no material for us to discuss said argument and thus we reject the same as also the argument of planting. [CARDINAL]. Is the learned counsel for the appellant right in contending that the opinion [ORG] implies that only injuries [ORG] and [CARDINAL] found on the person of the deceased were caused by the knife recovered from his possession and that the remaining injuries found on the person of the deceased was caused by another weapon We do not think so. Since only injuries [ORG] and [CARDINAL] found on the person of the deceased were responsible for the death of the deceased, Dr. [PERSON] [PERSON] PW-9, thought it proper to give his opinion with respect to the weapon of offence only in respect of said [CARDINAL] injuries. Realizing that the opinion exhibitPW- 9/2 does not give an opinion with respect to the weapon of [GPE]. [ORG] 747/2007 offence regarding all the injuries found on the person of the deceased, the investigating officer rightly thought it proper to obtain further opinion in respect of the remaining injuries on the person of the deceased. In that view of the matter, we find nothing suspicious in [CARDINAL] opinions [ORG] and [PRODUCT] being obtained from Dr. [PERSON] [PERSON] regarding the weapon of offence. [CARDINAL]. Regarding the argument that Dr. [PERSON] [PERSON] gave the opinion exhibitPW-9/3 without even looking at the knife recovered from the possession of the appellant, suffice would it be to note that Dr. [PERSON] [PERSON] penned the opinion [ORG] on the back page of the post mortem report [PERSON] and he also drew the sketch of the knife in question on the said page. Dr. [PERSON] [PERSON] deposed that he perused the post mortem report while giving the opinion [PRODUCT]. It is thus apparent that Dr. [PERSON] [PERSON] gave the opinion [PERSON] after examining the sketch of the knife in question. In that view of the matter, nothing turns upon the fact that Dr. [PERSON] [PERSON] did not look at the knife recovered from the possession of the appellant when rendering the opinion exhibitPW-9/3. [CARDINAL]. The argument that the sickle shaped injury found on the person of the deceased i.e. injury [ORG] could not have been caused by the knife recovered from the possession of [PERSON]. [ORG] 747/2007 the accused requires it to be noted that the knife in question, sketch whereof is exhibitPW-2/3, is a knife tapering towards the tip. Total length of the knife is [QUANTITY] [QUANTITY]. The length of the blade is [QUANTITY] [QUANTITY]. Therefore, the tapered portion of the knife could have caused the sickle shaped injury found on the person of the deceased. We find that Dr. [PERSON] [PERSON] was not given any suggestion that injury [PERSON] could not have possible been caused from the knife in question. [CARDINAL]. Regarding non joining of Satish Garg and his family members when the police came to the spot, suffice would it be to state that the father of the deceased deposed that Satish Garg was not present in the house at the time of the occurrence as he had gone to distribute the invitation cards for the marriage of the deceased. Thus, merely because Satish Garg resided on the ground floor of the same building is an irrelevant fact and can not be used as a ground to urge that a material witness has been withheld. [CARDINAL]. That [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] policemen accompanied Inspector [PERSON] [PERSON] to the spot being used as an argument to urge that usually [CARDINAL] police officers leave the police station when a crime is reported, it is important to note the contents of [GPE] entry exhibitPW-4/1. As already noted herein above, [GPE] entry exhibitPW-4/1 records that the father of the deceased informed that the appellant has locked the deceased in a bathroom [PERSON]. A.no.433/2007 747/2007 and that he is not opening the door inspite of repeated knocking at the door. Considering the fact that the deceased was locked in a bathroom by the appellant and thus he would require manpower to break open the door, Inspector [PERSON] [PERSON] must have thought it proper to take more policemen with him to the spot. Therefore, there is nothing suspicious in the fact that [CARDINAL] policemen accompanied the investigating officer to the said spot. [CARDINAL]. No question was put to Insp. [PERSON] as to why he took [CARDINAL] policemen along with him. Had [CARDINAL] been asked, an answer would have come and then we would have found some scope for a debate, whether the answer was convincing. It is settled law that without questioning a witness on a point of controversy and eliciting a response, no argument can be built on said controversy by hinging the controversy on surmises and conjectures. [CARDINAL]. The submission that it was unnatural conduct for the family members of the deceased to not break the door of the bathroom when they knew that the appellant was inside the bathroom with the deceased, though attractive at [ORDINAL] blush, ignores that as deposed to by the family members, the appellant had told them from inside that he had killed their daughter and thus, overcome by grief, fear and anxiety they could think of no better than to inform and summon the Crl. A.no.433/2007 747/2007 police and do no more. We do not think that so unnatural is the conduct that it renders the family members without any merit of credit. The argument that this fact does not find mention in the [GPE] entry exhibitPW-4/ A, it is sufficient to note that [GPE] entries are always cryptic and not descriptive. [CARDINAL]. The argument that it was highly improbable that the parents and the brothers of the deceased did not hear even a whisper of cry of the deceased when the appellant assaulted her ignores the possibility of the appellant taking the deceased by complete surprise and inflicting injuries Nos.1 and [CARDINAL] on her person before she could react and by said time she was rendered speechless. Being a male, the appellant could have muffled her voice with his hand placed on her mouth. [CARDINAL]. Do we not come across cases day after day where brutal crimes are committed with victims beaten to pulp and yet nobody in the vicinity has heard their cries We have. It is also not unknown for victims to be rendered speechless when suddenly placed in a hostile situation. [CARDINAL]. The argument that the appellant could not have picked up the knife used by him for murdering the deceased from the kitchen of the house of the deceased without [GPE] noticing the same is premised on the assumption that the knife was picked up from the kitchen. No suggestion has [PERSON]. A.no.433/2007 747/2007 been given by the appellant to any family member that the knife belonged to them or was in the kitchen. It is possible that the appellant took the knife with him hoping to get an opportunity to do what he did. It is possible that the knife was already in the bedroom. It is a kitchen knife no doubt. Such kinds of knives are placed in the dining room and are sometimes carried inside the bedroom to cut or peel fruit. Thus, the argument anchors itself nowhere. [CARDINAL]. The argument that nobody takes tuition at [TIME] [TIME] is neither here nor there for the reason Vibhor the person who claims as being taught by the appellant has not even been given a suggestion that he has falsely deposed that the appellant was imparting tuition to him at [TIME] [TIME] when his sister and mother returned after shopping from the market. Thus it stands established that the appellant was already in the house at [TIME] [TIME]. If this be so, the version of false entrapment falls flat. [CARDINAL]. The argument predicated on the denial by the family members of the deceased that the letters exhibitDW-4/1 to exhibitDW-4/17 were not in the handwriting of the deceased, denials which were proved to be false through the testimony of [ORG], takes the case of the appellant not an inch forward for the reason in a conservative [NORP] society, as already opined by us hereinbefore, an affair with the opposite sex is [PERSON]. A.no.433/2007 747/2007 considered by some families as unchaste behaviour it is thought to be shame upon the family and hence the desire to suppress the truth. It is obvious that the family members of the deceased were saving their perceived family honour. [CARDINAL]. Do the contents of the letters exhibitDW-4/1- 2 and [ORG] 4/3- 5 show that the brother of the deceased i.e. [ORG] and the maternal aunt of the deceased were aware of the fact that the deceased was having an affair with the accused [CARDINAL]. The argument was advanced to bring home what We do not understand. [CARDINAL]. Had they known so, the fact that the appellant is a married person and was more than twice the age of the deceased would have immediately led the family members of the deceased to declare the appellant a persona non grata in their house, which they did not do. It is obvious that neither [NORP] nor his aunt know anything about the liking which the appellant had for the deceased and vice versa. [ORG]. We have already commented hereinabove the intricacies involved in understanding the subtle undercurrents in love letters and especially when the writer has to hide his her true feelings. Save and except to gather that the writer of the letters i.e. the deceased was torn apart [PERSON]. [ORG] 747/2007 as a result of her love for the [NORP] the appellant of the letters, we can read no further except that the deceased realized that her brother [ORG] and her maternal aunt had sensed out something amiss in the joy of life of the deceased but what that was has not surfaced. Surely not the fact that [ORG] and his aunt knew about the relationship between the appellant and the deceased. [CARDINAL]. The fact that the parents of the deceased have deposed that the appellant used to treat the deceased as their daughter shows that they believed that as a teacher the appellant was as good as a parent to their child. This itself establishes the fact that nobody suspected anything and it is a case of a crafty man warming and worming into the heart of a young girl and emotionally and may be physically exploiting her. [CARDINAL]. The testimony of the parents Anil Garg PW-2 and [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], and the brothers Varun Garg PW-3 and Vibhor Garg PW-19 of the deceased, as also the police officers who participated in the spot investigation namely [PRODUCT]. Bhura Singh PW-13, Const. [PERSON] [PERSON] PW-14, Const. Mukesh PW-15 and [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and Inspector [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] PW-18 establishes that the appellant was found standing in the bathroom which was locked from inside and where [PERSON]. [ORG] 747/2007 the deceased was found dead and that he was holding a knife in his hand at that time. The aforesaid witnesses were cross examined in extenso by the defence but nothing could be brought out which could cast a blemish on their evidence. [CARDINAL]. There is yet another significant fact which needs to be noted. As already stated herein above, save and except giving suggestion to [GPE] that the appellant used to impart tuitions to him between [CARDINAL] [NORP] to [CARDINAL] P.M. and general suggestions pertaining to false implication of the appellant [GPE] was not cross examined with respect to essential portion of his testimony. Thus, the essential portion of the testimony of [GPE] has virtually gone unrebutted. [CARDINAL]. In the decision reported as M s. Chuni Lal Dwarka Nath Vs. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. AIR 1958 Punjab [CARDINAL] it was observed as under It is a well established rule of evidence that a party should put to each of his opponents witnesses so much of his case as concerns that particular witness. If no such questions are put, the Courts presume that the witness account has been accepted. If it is intended to suggest that a witness was not speaking the truth upon a particular point, his attention must first he directed to the fact by cross [PERSON]. [ORG] 747/2007 examination so that he may have an opportunity of giving an explanation. In Browne v. [PERSON], [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] A, Lord Herschell observed [CARDINAL]. From the above conspectus of facts, the only conclusion which results is that the appellant is the murderer of the deceased. [CARDINAL]. It assumes some significance to note that the letter exhibitDW-5/ PB written by the appellant to the parents of the Crl. [ORG] 747/2007 deceased has traces of admission of guilt, but we do not use the same as an extra judicial confession for lack of clarity of admission in unequivocal terms thereof. [CARDINAL]. We conclude by recording that the written submissions filed by the appellant in his own handwriting and the letters written by him to the parents of the deceased show a very crafty and a very fertile mind. The intelligence quotients of the appellant is of the highest order and as indeed bragged by him in one of his letter he has given a run for the money to a seasoned criminal lawyer of the stature of [ORG] [ORG], [GPE] [GPE] who was appointed as a Special Public Prosecutor in the instant case. It is apparent that the appellant has near successfully built a defence around the lapses committed by the prosecution on [CARDINAL] points, [ORDINAL] in not searching for the [CARDINAL] buttons which were broken from the shirt of the appellant and [ORDINAL] the investigating officer not seizing the bolt hole with the screws coming loose when the door of the bathroom was pushed open. It is obvious that entry into the bathroom could not be effected without the door being opened and this was possible in the instant case when due to the push the bolt hole came off from the door frame as the screws gave way when pressure was applied on the door. It was common sense for the Crl. [ORG] 747/2007 investigating officer to have seized the bolt hole and the screws. But, with pain and anguish we must write that in [CARDINAL] out of [CARDINAL] cases we are seeing errors of stupidity committed by the investigating officers which have to be overlooked as aberrations by us for the reason it is the duty of the [ORG] to balance public interest in the administration of justice requiring the exception to be applied to the exclusionary rule of excluding from consideration the investigation which is otherwise without taint. Indeed, it is time for the police to think and find an answer as to why in [CARDINAL] out of [CARDINAL] movies in [GPE] where there is some role of a policeman in the theme, the policeman is shown as a [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. We dismiss [PERSON]. Appeal no.433/2007 filed by the appellant [PERSON] [PERSON]. [CARDINAL]. As regards the [ORG] Appeal filed by the [ORG], noting that the prayer made therein is to enhance the sentence, noting that the learned Trial Judge has himself directed that the appellant shall undergo imprisonment for life and while exercising the power to commute or remit the sentence the decision of the learned Judge, which brings out in the very [ORDINAL] paragraph the evilness and depravity in the crime, would be placed before the [ORG], meaning thereby the appellant would not earn his freedom on completing [CARDINAL] Crl. [ORG] [DATE] [DATE] imprisonment, we feel that no case is made out to enhance the sentence by awarding death penalty. [CARDINAL]. Thus, Cross Appeal filed by the [ORG] is also dismissed. [CARDINAL]. Both appeals are dismissed. [CARDINAL].

The judgment by [ORG], [PERSON] held that the definition of business did not exclude profit motive nor did it include sales in connection with the main activity. The textile mills main activity did indisputably amount to carrying on business but in regard to the incidental sales of unserviceable or discarded goods, it was held that these sales were intended only for reduction of the space and to save accommodation and were not so integrated with or connected with the main business even if they were of considerable volume and frequency. [CARDINAL]. The other argument of the petitioner rests on the fact that when the vehicles cars were purchased the said items were taxable at [ORDINAL] point i.e. w.e.f. [CARDINAL] to 02.09.2001 therefore accordingly purchases were made after payment of tax. Since the tax had been paid at the time of purchase, the sale of said vehicles can not be taxed in view of provisions of[ SECTION] whereunder notification no. F. 4 67/95 Fin. G i dated [CARDINAL] was issued. The said notification was withdrawn on 03.09.2001. Thereafter, sale of cars vehicles became taxable at last point in notification no. [PERSON] [PERSON] 69 2001- FIN 2318- 26 dated 03.09.2001 no protection saving clause was [ORG] no. [DATE] Page 8 provided incorporated in respect of cars vehicles which were purchased under the [ORDINAL] point regime and were sold after use during the last point regime from levy of tax. [CARDINAL]. Sales tax is an indirect tax. It is leviable on transfer of goods. It is, however, well settled that while construing a taxing statute one has to look merely at what is clearly said. See speech of [PERSON] [PERSON] referred to in State of West Bengal v. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and [ORG]. [CARDINAL] [ORG] 721 [ORG], wherein it was noticed expressing the principle in the following words In a taxing Act one has to look merely at what is clearly said. There is [ORG] no. [DATE] Page 9 no room for any intendment. There is no equity about a tax. There is no presumption as to tax. Nothing is to be read in, nothing is to be implied. One can only look fairly at the language used. at p. [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL]. In the present case, the main business of the petitioner is manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products and the vehicles are used by it in the course of business as written by Respondent no.-2 in the impugned order [PERSON] [PERSON]. This may lead to the inference that proceeds from the sales of such vehicles should have been included in the turnover and must be taxed accordingly. But the selling of used cars can not by any stretch of the imagination be characterized as ancillary or incidental to the business of a pharmaceutical company. It is not shown that the cars were of a special character e.g. air conditioned vehicles especially designed to store and ferry pharmacy products. They were purchased for use of company employees and executives, for office purposes. At the stage of purchase, they suffered sales tax, which the assessee, as buyer, was bound to pay. However, the assessee never held them for the purpose of sale and purchase, but for using them. After their use, having regard to lapse of time, and their wear and tear, the assessee decided to replace them. These cars were then sold. Their sales, in a sense are twice removed from the business of the assesse. They can not be called incidental or ancillary to the manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products, which the assesse is engaged in. WPC no. [DATE] Page [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL]. This court also notices that the vehicles had already been taxed once under the [ORDINAL] point tax regime then in cases of transactions which are redundant and can not be considered under the definition of business as they were aimed mainly to get rid of old vehicles which are carried on by persons in normal course of their lives as well and previous orders of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] have also been in favour of the petitioner itself, the levy of sales tax on an already taxed vehicle with little relation to the business will give rise to an anomaly. [CARDINAL]. In view of the above discussion, it is held that the view taken by the respondents, regarding inclusion of the sales transaction of the cars in question, in the turnover of the petitioner, is unsustainable in law. The impugned orders are consequently quashed the writ petition is allowed. In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs.

      " [CARDINAL]. Petitioner is the employee of respondent [ORG] who, vide letter of [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] had informed petitioner that she has lost her [PERSON] due to voluntary abandonment of service. The challenge in this writ petition is to the impugned letter of [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. [CARDINAL]. Petitioner was Senior Marketing Assistant, [ORG] I with respondent [ORG] at [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and she claims to have obtained No Objection Certificate to obtain [ORG] for visiting U.S.A. in [DATE], W.P.C [DATE] [DATE] and according to petitioner, the No Objection Certificate was granted to her on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] but a day prior thereto i.e. [CARDINAL] th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], she was transferred to [PERSON] office of respondent [ORG] and was directed to join duty at [PERSON] in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Petitioner claims to have sprained her right ankle and was unable to join the duties and had applied for medical leave from [CARDINAL] th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] alongwith the medical certificate. Petitioner had represented against her transfer to [PERSON] and had applied for [DATE] [DATE] of privilege leave from [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Petitioner also claims to have been harassed by respondent [CARDINAL]. On [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], petitioner had filed a complaint to [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] against the harassment of petitioner by respondent [CARDINAL] and on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], petitioner had proceeded to [GPE] and [GPE] on the privilege leave. According to petitioner, she could not return back to [GPE] and had sought extension of her leave vide Fax Messages of 9th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], [ORDINAL] upto [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and then [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT]. [CARDINAL]. Respondent no.2 got issued [ORG] [ORG] of 9th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] about petitioners absence without permission and vide aforesaid [ORG], petitioner was directed to report for duty within [DATE] [DATE]. Petitioner claims that upon her return to [GPE] on [CARDINAL] th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], she had met with an accident and had applied for leave from [CARDINAL] th September to [ORDINAL] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] but respondent [ORG] did not respond. Upon recovery from illness, petitioner claims to have reported to respondent [CARDINAL] for joining her duties in [GPE] but she was not allowed to do so. Vide letter of [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], respondent [ORG] had informed W.P.C [DATE] petitioner that she had voluntarily abandoned the service w.e.f. 2nd [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and had lost her lien. [CARDINAL]. Vide Notice of 20th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] petitioner was informed by respondent [ORG] that the gratuity payable is being sent to her at her last known address. Petitioner claims to have learnt about [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] of 9th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and the impugned letter Annexure P on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and had called upon respondent [ORG] to withdraw the aforesaid [ORG] [ORG] and petitioner had sent back the gratuity amount cheques to respondent [ORG]. Again on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], petitioner had called upon respondent [ORG] to cancel the impugned order and to regularize her service and allow her to join her duties at [GPE], but to no avail and so, petitioner had filed this writ petition through her father. [CARDINAL]. The stand taken by respondent [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in the counter filed is that in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], a need was felt to provide an Executive Assistant and [CARDINAL] more staff in the office of Chairman and Managing Director of respondent [ORG] and no spare personnel was found in the office of respondent [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and so, petitioner was transferred from [GPE] to Goa. It is denied by respondent [ORG] that petitioner applied for obtaining No Objection Certificate to get [ORG] for visiting [GPE] and General Manager [GPE] had no authority to issue No Objection Certificate as it has to be processed through [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of respondent [ORG]. Upon transfer of petitioner to [PERSON], she had not joined her duties at [PERSON] and vide letter of [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], petitioner was called upon to comply with the W.P.C [DATE] transfer order. [CARDINAL]. It was maintained by respondent [ORG] that Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON], Manager in [ORG] [ORG] who had made endorsement of [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], had improperly processed petitioners application as it was not in the prescribed pro forma and since Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON] had colluded with petitioner, therefore, he was dismissed from service. Respondent no.2 maintained that petitioner had colluded with aforesaid Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON] and had fabricated some documents to avoid the transfer order and the sanction of leave to petitioner, which was purportedly approved, is also fabricated as above said Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON] could not have sanctioned the leave to petitioner beyond [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. According to respondent [ORG], petitioner was absent from duty and there was no indication in the record that she was on leave. [CARDINAL]. Petitioners stand of her obtaining the No Objection Certificate is categorically denied. However, it was admitted that fax messages were received from petitioner, but the address of petitioner was not available on these fax messages and so, correspondence with petitioner was made at the last known address of petitioner. According to respondent [ORG], attempts to deliver the impugned letter at the house of petitioner proved futile as she was not found at the last known address and her brother [PERSON] [PERSON] had refused to receive the letter and had not disclosed the whereabouts of petitioner. [PERSON] of writ petition is sought by respondent [CARDINAL] by maintaining that petitioner had abandoned the service and she is in [GPE] since long. [CARDINAL]. At the final hearing, it was submitted by learned Senior Counsel W.P.C [DATE] for petitioner that the transfer order of petitioner issued in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] was motivated as petitioner had spurned the advances of respondent [CARDINAL]. It was also submitted that petitioner had applied for No Objection Certificate to obtain [ORG] for visiting U.S.A. to attend the convocation programme of her brother and it was allowed on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. It was further submitted that petitioner had sought recall of the transfer order and the date of joining the place of posting was extended upto 24th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] vide letter of [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. [CARDINAL]. Learned counsel for petitioner further submitted that petitioner was granted [DATE] [DATE] privilege leave from [DATE] [DATE] till [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and prior thereto, petitioner had applied for sick leave from [CARDINAL] th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] due to sprain in her right ankle and she was granted the sick leave. It was pointed out that petitioner had also filed a criminal complaint against respondent [CARDINAL] in which respondent [CARDINAL] has been summoned for various offences. It was further submitted that petitioner had proceeded to [GPE] as per the sanctioned leave and had sent fax messages and had sought extension of her leave upto [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. It is submitted in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], petitioner had learnt about the publication of [ORG] regarding her being absent without leave and on return from abroad, petitioner had met with an accident and had sought leave from [EVENT] [EVENT] upto 4th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and upon, learning about the impugned letter, petitioner had promptly applied for extension of leave and thus, it was vehemently refuted that she had abandoned the job voluntarily. [CARDINAL]. [ORG] was placed by learned counsel for petitioner upon [DATE] [DATE] decisions in [EVENT] [EVENT] and [ORG]. v. [ORG] and [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. [DATE] 1 SCC 590 and [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] v. Presiding Officer, [ORG] [ORG], [GPE] and [ORG]. [MONEY] [MONEY] [MONEY] [MONEY] to submit that since petitioner was seeking extension of her leave, therefore, it can not be assumed that she had abandoned the job and so, there is no question of losing the [PERSON] on appointment. It was submitted that without holding an inquiry, petitioner can not be thrown out of service in the manner respondent has done. [CARDINAL]. It was also submitted that Clause 30 b of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] mandates that without an inquiry, the service of an employee can not be dispensed with. In support of the above submission, reliance was placed upon decisions in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] v. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and [ORG]. [DATE] [DATE] [ORG] [CARDINAL] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] v. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and [ORG]. AIR 1991 [MONEY] [CARDINAL] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] v. [PERSON] [PERSON] and [PERSON]. AIR 1998 SC [DATE] [GPE] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG].

[CARDINAL]. Learned counsel for respondent [ORG] supported the impugned order and submitted that there was no challenge to transfer order of [CARDINAL] th W.P.C [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] whereby petitioner was transferred from Delhi to Goa and after [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] of the impugned order, instant writ petition has been filed by petitioner through her father. It was submitted that neither petitioners application seeking privilege leave of [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] nor the letter of [ORDINAL] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] by Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON], Manager of [ORG] [ORG] granting the privilege leave to petitioner is on record. It was pointed out that Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON] was not the Regional Manager at [GPE] but was just a Manager in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and he had no authority to sanction any kind of leave or to recommend issuance of No Objection Certificate. It was maintained by learned counsel for respondent [ORG] that the application and the sanction letter are fabricated and service of aforesaid Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON] was terminated. It was pointed out that the No Objection Certificate issued to petitioner for travelling abroad as recommended by aforesaid Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON], Manager, [ORG] [ORG] and approved by the General Manager Technical on [CARDINAL] th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] was not on prescribed pro forma and was not sanctioned by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] i.e. the [ORG] Secretary or [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. It was further pointed out that the stand taken by contesting respondent [ORG] in the counter filed regarding the application for leave and its sanction being fabricated remains uncontroverted by petitioner as no rejoinder to the counter filed is on record. It was next submitted that though the leave sought by petitioner w.e.f. 9th June to [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] by way of Fax Message is not disputed, but in the fax message, no address W.P.C [DATE] of petitioner was there and so, it could not be communicated to her that the said leave stands declined. However, it is admitted that the time for joining the place of posting was extended by contesting respondent [GPE] till [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] vide [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. It is pointed out that even after returning to [GPE] on [CARDINAL] th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], petitioner had made no attempt to report for duty at the place of her posting and had made Representation on [CARDINAL] th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] after passing of the impugned order. It was submitted that [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] are of no avail because petitioner had not expressed any intention of joining duty at the place of her posting. [ORG] was placed upon decisions in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] v. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [ORG] 253 [ORG] [ORG] v. [ORG] Secretary [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. 2000 5 SCC 65 and Regional Manager Bank of Baroda v. [PERSON] [PERSON] 2009 9 SCC 462 to submit that no departmental inquiry was required to be held as petitioner had voluntarily abandoned her job and despite publication of [ORG] [ORG] in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], petitioner had not come forward to join the place of her posting. Lastly, it was submitted that the intention of petitioner was not to continue with the job as she was in [GPE] since [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and had worked with Consulate General of [GPE] at [GPE] as Market Assistant from [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] till [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. [CARDINAL]. After having heard learned counsel for the parties at length and upon careful perusal of material on record and the decisions cited, this W.P.C 6616/1998 Court finds that while dealing with the case of abandonment of service, it has to be gathered from the facts and circumstances of the case as to whether the employee had any intention of abandoning the job or not. Though petitioner had not challenged the transfer order of [CARDINAL] th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], but she had made [LOC] on 20th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] wherein she had categorically stated that her younger brother is settled in [GPE] and she alongwith her parents is trying to join him but there are some visa hurdles which would be overcome within few months and if all goes well, then she will request to be relieved from service. In this Representation, petitioner had also stated that she was prepared to submit her resignation if she is found redundant in [ORG] [ORG] or if she gives any chance to her superiors for any complaint. It is matter of record that petitioners [LOC] was not accepted and vide [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] was granted time till [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] to comply with the transfer order failing which suitable action would be initiated against her. Instead of joining the place of her posting, petitioner had sought privilege leave from [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] for going abroad and the said leave was purportedly sanctioned by Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON], Manager in [ORG] [ORG] of respondent whereas [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] to sanction such a leave was the Manager Personnel and Administration. Not only the leave was sanctioned by the Local Manager who was not authorized to sanction the leave but even the application for privilege leave and the sanction letter are not on the record of respondent. This is a quite disturbing feature of this case. Apart from this, the No Objection Certificate issued to petitioner for travelling [DATE] [DATE] abroad was also not issued by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. The application to obtain No Objection Certificate had to be on prescribed pro forma and was required to be sanctioned by the [ORG] Secretary or [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] whereas it has been sanctioned by the General Manager Technical on the recommendation of Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON], Manager at [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. It is also a matter of record that without any proper sanction of leave, petitioner remained absent from duty from [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] onwards while seeking extension of leave, which was not granted and since [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], petitioner was in [GPE] and was working there. Is it not a serious mis conduct that while being on purported leave, petitioner was working in [GPE] from [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] The intention of petitioner to abandon her job is quite evident from her conduct, as noticed herein above. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of 9th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] published in newspaper [ORG] [ORG], petitioner was called upon to join the duty at the place of her posting and to explain her absence from duty failing which her [PERSON] on appointment shall stand terminated. Petitioner claims to have learnt about [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and she had made a Representation on 13th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] wherein she had threatened to initiate civil and criminal proceedings while alleging harassment but had not expressed any intention of reporting for duty at the place of her posting. Vide impugned Communication of 10th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] petitioner was informed by the contesting respondent that she has remained absent without leave and so, her [PERSON] on her appointment stood terminated due W.P.C [DATE] to voluntary abandonment of service. Even in the Representation of [CARDINAL] th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], petitioner had not expressed any intention of resuming the duties at the place of her posting. [CARDINAL]. No doubt, petitioner had lodged a criminal complaint for the offences under[ SECTION] etc. regarding her harassment but she had not pursued the said complaint and so, it was quashed. Adverse notice needs to be taken on the fact that petitioner had not challenged her transfer order alleging harassment at the hands of respondent [CARDINAL]. Had petitioner been serious in continuing with her job, then instead of her proceeding on unauthorized leave and getting it extended from time to time, petitioner ought to have challenged her transfer order alleging harassment. In the absence of rejoinder to the counter filed by respondent, the version put forth by contesting respondent has to be accepted. It is evident from the stand taken by contesting respondent that petitioner was on unauthorized leave and in spite of extending the time of her joining the duty, petitioner had proceeded abroad and was infact working there. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], petitioner was called upon to join the duties but instead of doing so, she continued to represent without any justification. [CARDINAL]. A recent decision of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in Vijay S. Sathaye supra, relied upon by petitioner, sums up the law on the subject. It stands reiterated by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in Vijay S. Sathaye supra that absence from duty in the beginning may be a misconduct, but when absence is for a very long period, it may amount to voluntary abandonment of service and in that eventuality, the bonds of service come to an end [DATE] [DATE] automatically without requiring any order to be passed by the employer. In the instant case, the sequence of events, as noticed above, make out a clear cut case of voluntary abandonment of service and so, undue reliance upon principles of justice is uncalled for as despite issuance of [ORG] [ORG], petitioner had not come forward to resume the duties although an opportunity to do so was provided by contesting respondent in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. The fact that the instant writ petition has been filed after [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] of passing of the impugned order speaks volumes of the intention of petitioner to abandon her job. The irresistible conclusion, which can be reasonably drawn, is that petitioner had no intention of joining the duties from the very beginning. Petitioner had infact lost [PERSON] on appointment due to voluntary abandonment of service when she had started doing a job in [GPE] while being on purported leave. [CARDINAL]. In the facts and circumstances of this case, this [ORG] is of the considered view that holding of an ex parte inquiry would have been an empty formality. Such a view is being taken as Apex Court in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] supra has already clarified that in a case of loss of [PERSON], an opportunity should be given to employee to show cause against the action proposed and this would satisfy the requirement of the principles of natural justice. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of 9th [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] issued to petitioner is a sufficient compliance of principles of natural justice in the instant case. It is thus held that impugned order terminating the [PERSON] of petitioner on appointment due to voluntary abandonment of service does not violate the principles of natural justice. [CARDINAL]. Consequentially, this petition deserves dismissal and it is accordingly dismissed while leaving the parties to bear their own costs. SUNIL GAUR JUDGE [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] s W.P.C [DATE]\n",

It is stated that the petitioner association is registered under [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW], [DATE] [DATE] and importers of vegetable seeds are its members. [CARDINAL]. The petitioners have primarily impugned General [PERSON] Circular no.11/2013 dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] issued by office of the Commissioner of [ORG], [GPE] and the decision dated [CARDINAL] th [DATE], W.P. C no. [DATE] [DATE] by the Director [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of Excise and [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] pursuant to order dated [ORDINAL] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] passed in W.P.C no.5245/2016. [CARDINAL]. We do not see any reason to entertain the present writ petition for several reasons. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] has not filed list of its members but it appears that some of its members are facing proceedings pursuant to show cause notices issued to them. The issue and contentions raised is whether the coriander seeds and chilly seeds imported by the members of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] were covered under tariff item no.12099190 or under tariff item [DATE] and [DATE] respectively. The latter items are applicable to spices. [CARDINAL]. Whether the goods imported by a particular person were spices or coriander and chilly seeds would be primarily a factual dispute. This lis has to be decided and adjudicated on case to case basis. [CARDINAL]. The respondents obviously would be entitled to contend and rely upon the reasoning given in the communication dated [CARDINAL] th [DATE], [DATE] and the General Alert Circular no.11/2013. The importer would urge and content to the contrary. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], as an appellate authority, would examine the entire issue depending upon facts of each case. [CARDINAL]. General [PERSON] Circular no.11/2013 was issued in the earlier regime when [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] was payable. Goods and Services Tax has since been imposed with effect from [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. This could have its effect, as accepted by counsel for the petitioner. [CARDINAL]. Recording the above, we are not issuing notice in the present writ petition and leave it open to the members of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] to take up their stand and stance in each specific case. If aggrieved, they would be entitled to take recourse to remedies available to them under law. We have passed the said order as it is the contention of the respondents that spices were being imported as seeds and, therefore, the above [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] no.11/2013 was issued. The intent was to stop and prevent misuse. [CARDINAL]. The writ petition is accordingly not entertained and is disposed of with the aforesaid observations without expressing any opinion on merits.

      " [CARDINAL]. The petitioners have filed the present objections appeal under[ SECTION], [DATE] hereinafter referred to as the Act for setting aside the award dated [ORDINAL] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] published by the sole arbitrator on the grounds mainly that it is violative of law and against public policy. [CARDINAL]. The petitioner [ORG] is a resident of [ORG]. He had [CARDINAL] of the paid up capital of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] The petitioner [CARDINAL] is a company registered under [LAW] [LAW] [LAW], [DATE] [DATE], having its registered office at [GPE] [GPE]. Respondents no.1 and [CARDINAL] were the shareholders of the petitioner [ORG] company and together had [CARDINAL] of the total issue share capital. [CARDINAL]. Brief facts as per petitioners pleadings are that in the course of business, the respondents expressed their intent to exit the pharmaceutical business. The petitioner [ORG] agreed to buy the shares of the respondents. Accordingly, on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], a shareholding agreement for re arranging the share holding pattern was executed. [CARDINAL]. It was agreed between the parties in the agreement that the respondents would sell and transfer all their shares in favour of petitioner no.1 who shall make payments in [CARDINAL] instalments by way of issuance of post dated cheques. As per payment of the consideration, the respondents shall proportionately transfer their shareholding in the company. [CARDINAL]. It was also agreed between the parties that upon receipt of cheques the respondents shall resign from [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of the company. The petitioner no.1 shall also get the property papers belonging to the respondents released from [GPE] [GPE] wherein the same had been kept as collateral purposes. [CARDINAL]. In terms of the said agreement, the petitioner no.1 paid a sum of [CARDINAL] as per the schedule of payment agreed between the parties and also got the property papers released from the [ORG] and requested the respondents to transfer the proportionate number of shares in his favour. The petitioner no.1 further paid a sum of [CARDINAL] and again requested the respondents for transfer of shares. As per the case of the petitioners they came to know that the respondents were spreading misleading information to the employees consultants at [GPE] and had instructed them not to remit the funds or clear invoice receipts without any written instructions from the respondents. [CARDINAL]. Feeling aggrieved by the acts of the respondents, the petitioner no.1 by notice dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] terminated the agreement and intimated the respondents to not to present the post dated cheques issued by him. [CARDINAL]. When the respondents presented the post dated cheques in bank which were returned with the endorsement payment stopped insufficient funds in account. The respondents, thereafter, sent an email to petitioner no.1 asking him to clear the cheques otherwise they would initiate proceedings under [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW], [DATE], [DATE] against him. [CARDINAL]. Again by letter dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] the petitioner asked the respondents by notice dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] not to present the cheques but the respondents presented the cheques for payment which were again returned unpaid with remark [PERSON] [PERSON]. [CARDINAL]. The respondents thereafter issued a legal notice dated [CARDINAL] st [DATE], [DATE] under[ SECTION] to which the petitioner no.1 sent a reply dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. [CARDINAL]. The petitioner [ORG] issued a legal notice dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] calling upon the respondents to refund a sum of [CARDINAL] paid towards the purchase of shares in terms of the agreement and further to pay a sum of [CARDINAL] towards the loss of business suffered due to misrepresentations made by the respondents. [CARDINAL]. Thereafter, disputes having arisen between the parties, the petitioners invoked the arbitration clause vide letter dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and asked the respondents to propose the name of the arbitrators. On [DATE] [DATE], [DATE] the respondents instituted proceedings under[ SECTION_UNK] 11 6 of the Act before this court seeking ad interim directions against the petitioner also for appointment of Arbitrator by court. [CARDINAL]. By order dated [ORDINAL] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] the petition under[ SECTION_UNK] the Act was dismissed. By order dated [DATE] [DATE], [DATE] Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON] O.M.P. [PERSON] [PERSON] was appointed the sole Arbitrator after the respondent moved to this court under[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act. [CARDINAL]. Respondents claimants in the arbitration proceedings submitted their claim before the [ORG] [ORG] pleading that- 15. It was alleged by the respondents that the petitioners committed breach of agreement by making false grounds that shareholding deserves to be transferred simultaneously to part payments received by the respondents. The petitioners made allegations against the respondents for having dealings with overseas buyers of pharmaceutical goods which resulted in withholding of payments of goods sold realizable. [CARDINAL]. It was alleged by the respondents that after the petitioners levelled such allegations upon the respondents inquired from overseas buyers at [GPE] other countries who confirmed that funds stand transferred to petitioner [ORG] company on different dates. It is confirmed from [GPE] that in pursuance of contract funds stood transferred on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] in [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] U.S. Dollars equivalent to [CARDINAL] lacs. [CARDINAL]. Correspondence exchanged between both parties post to execution of shareholders agreement is as follows- 18. The following amount demanded by the respondents from [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. The petitioners filed reply to the claim petition. Basic contentions raised in the reply are they violated clause [CARDINAL] of the shareholders agreement because they have given negative input and payments are not received from overseas buyers at [GPE] and other places iii Petitioners paid to the respondents [ORDINAL] [CARDINAL] installments amounting to [CARDINAL] lacs and proportionate shares were not transferred by the respondents. This was also breach of agreement. iv Finally in para [CARDINAL] of the petition pleaded that the petitioners are ready and willing to settle amounts due and payable to the respondents in accordance to the terms of shareholders agreement. Amount claimed in claim petition is excessive. v The details contained in claim petition about remittance of payment by overseas buyers to the petitioners are not disputed. [CARDINAL]. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] after examining the said pleadings and after discussing the matter with the petitioners came to a conclusion that issues which require determination and adjudication are narrowed down to Both the parties submitted to adjudication of these issues before the [ORG]. Documents which were relied upon are- [CARDINAL]. The respondents submitted that [PERSON]. [PERSON] was received on [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Allegations made by the petitioners are false as there is no material to support averments and allegations contained in letter [PERSON]. C-1. It was submitted that there is no breach on the part of the respondents warranting the determination of shareholders agreement. Clause-9 of the shareholders agreement is specific to the effect stating The petitioners alleged breach on the part of the respondents to the ingredients of the said clause, though neither any material was placed on record nor there were any pleadings on this aspect. Exhibits C-1 to [ORG] are documents constituting event of default on the part of the respondents on touch stone of clause [CARDINAL] of the shareholders agreement. Clause 9 reads- 22. Requirement of clause [CARDINAL] to be considered as default for respondents are- [CARDINAL]. The case of the respondents is that no pleadings are made even in the reply to claim petition. In so far as dealing resting between petitioner and overseas buyer, claim petition specifically pleaded, details of payment O.M.P. [PERSON] received by company from overseas buyer, which details are admitted on account of non denial. [CARDINAL]. It was alleged by the respondents that the other requirement in sub clause [CARDINAL] of clause [CARDINAL] of shareholders agreement is, that in case they discourage any [ORDINAL] party from doing business with the company. Exhibits C-1 to [ORG] does not state name of any [ORDINAL] party to whom claimants respondent ever made any statement of fact discouraging from doing business with company with back up of facts details of [DATE], date, event etc. Therefore, ingredients of clause [CARDINAL] to be termed as an event of default on part of claimants respondent is also not made out. Resultantly there is no basis or reason which can be termed as cause for petitioner to determine shareholders agreement. [CARDINAL]. The allegation made against respondents of non receipt of payment from overseas buyer is that it does not fall under clause [CARDINAL]. Even if payment is considered as part of said clause, there is no allegation whereby mentioning any name specifically of [ORDINAL] party to whom claimants have given any negative input amounting to discourage from doing business with company. [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] or any event is stated or mentioned. [CARDINAL]. It was submitted by the respondents that non receipt of payment therefore can not be considered as an act covered under clause [CARDINAL]. But even if it is considered, still there is no material or basis or reasons or substance to support the said allegation. [CARDINAL]. It was also submitted by the respondents that the said issue loses its importance and significance because petitioners herein did not deny in para [CARDINAL] of reply or anywhere in his reply about fact of non receipt of payment from [GPE] or elsewhere, which details are furnished by claimant extensively in claim petition. The facts admitted need no proof. The petitioners have no grievance or any suffering on issue of payment. Thus, all pleas from all directions for purposes of constituting an event of default to be attributed to claimant is missing lacking. The petitioners thus did not have any right to cause alleged termination of agreement. The termination is also not pressed in view of reply of para [CARDINAL] filed before [ORG] [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. The respondents referred to clause [CARDINAL] wherein there is no such mention of performance of obligation of doing positive publicity. Further the shares were required to be transferred by claimants proportionately to receipt of payment in installments. [CARDINAL] installments were paid and no shares were transferred. [CARDINAL]. Issue [ORG] was the primary issue and issues no. 2 and 3 were consequential to it. Based on the terms of the agreement, claim petition, reply to the claim petition and discussions, the Arbitrator answered issue no.1 in favour of the respondents. It is stated in the award that the letter dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] does not contain either any facts or any material governed by clause [CARDINAL] of the shareholders agreement. Clause 11 provides procedure for termination of the agreement by either party giving [DATE] [DATE] written notice to the other party on occurrence of event of default and in the absence of facts and material required for invocation of clause [CARDINAL] of the said agreement the action initiated by respondent petitioner herein is not valid. [CARDINAL]. After considering all the evidence and arguments, the learned Arbitrator passed the award and ordered the petitioner no.1 herein to pay [CARDINAL] lac in total to the respondents, i.e. [CARDINAL] lac as per the shareholders agreement against installment [CARDINAL], [DATE] and [DATE], for which post dated cheques were issued and which were dishonoured interest [CARDINAL] p.a. from respective date of installment due to the date of Award to the tune of [CARDINAL] lac and costs of arbitral proceedings to the tune of [CARDINAL] lac. The interest was also awarded to the respondents from date of the arbitral award to the date of payment [CARDINAL] [GPE] [GPE] on [CARDINAL] lac. [CARDINAL]. As per the Award rendered by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], findings are that- 32. The main case of the petitioners, in the objections under[ SECTION_UNK] is that the learned Arbitrator passed the said award only on the basis of the pleading without giving any opportunity to examine the witnesses. By adopting a summary procedure impermissible under the law. The Arbitrator did not appreciate the fact that the petitioners have terminated the shareholders agreement on account of committing defaults on the part of the respondents. The said dispute could have only been established by leading O.M.P. [PERSON] evidence of witnesses and just from documentary evidence. The sole Arbitrator failed to appreciate that once an agreement had been terminated then specific performance of the same could not be directed and the only remedy available to the aggrieved was to claim damages. In the impugned award, various reliefs were granted even those are not claimed statement of claim. The petitioners argue that no doubt, the [ORG] is empowered to adopt its own procedure but there are certain norms which are mandatory. [CARDINAL]. It is submitted that the impugned award is against the public policy as the same has been passed without following the due process of law as the impugned award deals and decides the matters beyond the scope of the submission statement of claim to arbitration. The award in effect gives directions of specific performance of the agreement dated [CARDINAL] nd [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] to the petitioners to pay the balance sum of [CARDINAL] lacs and thereafter directing the respondents to transfer [CARDINAL] of the shareholding to the petitioners. [CARDINAL]. It is argued that even otherwise the stand of the respondents is correct and that even assuming that the petitioners were guilty of breach of contract though this is denied then also the impugned award ignores[ SECTION_UNK] of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW]. While awarding compensation or breach of contract, the explanation to[ SECTION_UNK] clearly elaborates that in estimating the loss or damage arising from a breach of contract, the means which existed of remedying the inconvenience caused by the non performance of the contract must be taken into account. Hence, if the shareholders agreement was not properly implemented, the respondents were obliged to show the steps taken to sell the shares in the market i.e. to mitigate the damages. There is no pleading to this effect and no attempt is made by the impugned order to go O.M.P. [PERSON] into the mitigation of the damages. Counsel for the petitioners has referred the following decisions [PERSON] [PERSON] Narain Garg Vs. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]., [CARDINAL] 2012 DLT [CARDINAL]. b. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] Vs. [PERSON] [PERSON], [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. It is the case of the petitioner is that instead of the interpretation placed on the contract terms by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], another interpretation of the contract terms is possible. [CARDINAL]. The respondents case is that there was only one interpretation possible and the same was resorted to by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in the arbitral award. However even if it were to be assumed, without admitting, that an alternative interpretation is possible it is submitted by the respondent that [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] has repeatedly held that even if [CARDINAL] interpretations are possible and if the interpretation given by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] is a possible view, even though the [ORG] may have a different view, the Award will not be interfered with by the [ORG] under[ SECTION_UNK]. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in the case of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] Vs. Union of India Anr., [DATE] 9 SCC [CARDINAL], in paragraph [CARDINAL] of the said judgment, has held as [DATE] [DATE]. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] is the final arbiter of the disputes between the parties referred to it. In the present case the parties by themselves have agreed in the contract to accept the [PERSON] as final and conclusive. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] has expounded on the principle as to the sanctity of the O.M.P. [PERSON] decision of the arbitrator in the case of [PERSON] [PERSON] and [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. Union of [GPE], 2007 7 SCC 679, where in paragraph [CARDINAL] of the said judgment it was observed as [DATE] [DATE]. With regard to the payments from the companys customers in [GPE] and [ORG], due payments were made. The respondents further submit that this fact was not denied by the petitioners in the pleadings before the arbitral tribunal. This would falsify the entire claim of the petitioners, who did not have any right to terminate the shareholders agreement as the petitioner had consented to the procedure to be followed and that he was not denied any chance in being heard by the tribunal during the course of the disputes. [CARDINAL]. The undisputed fact is that according to the shareholders agreement, the [CARDINAL] stake in the share capital of the petitioner company was to be transferred after the petitioner had paid the amount in full. Further, this payment should have been completed in [CARDINAL] installments, as per the wishes of the parties. The respondents allege that the petitioners have illegally breached the terms of the contract and thereby, claim damages for the same before the tribunal. It is settled law that a person who has not complied with the terms of contract and has acted in contravention to the terms of agreement can not be entitled to take advantage of its own wrong and claim damages compensation. [CARDINAL]. In the case of [ORG] [ORG] [PERSON] [PERSON] vs State of [GPE], AIR 1984 SC [DATE], while interpreting the provisions of[ SECTION] [DATE], [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] held that damages can be claimed by a contractor where the government is proved to have committed breach by improperly rescinding the contract and for estimating the amount of damages, court should make a broad evaluation instead of going into minute details. It was specifically held that where in the works contract, the party entrusting the work committed breach of contract, the contractor is entitled to claim the damages for loss of profit which he expected to earn by undertaking the works contract. Claim of expected profits is legally admissible on proof of the breach of contract by the erring party. It was further observed that [CARDINAL]. In BSNL vs [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], [DATE] 1 SCC [CARDINAL], this [ORG] held as [DATE] [DATE]. In the case of [GPE] Madhusoodhanan Anr. Vs. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], [DATE] 9 SCC [CARDINAL]. In paras [CARDINAL] and 141 it is held as [DATE] [DATE]. In the case of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. Dewan Chand [PERSON] [PERSON], [DATE] [CARDINAL] SCC 306, [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in paras [CARDINAL] to 23 and 43 to 45 held as [DATE] [DATE]. The scope of[ SECTION], [DATE] is limited to the stipulations contained in[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act. The jurisdiction of the [ORG] to interfere with an Award of the Arbitrator is always statutory.[ SECTION_UNK] is of mandatory nature, and an Award can be set aside only on the [ORG] finding the existence of the grounds enumerated therein and in no other way. The words in[ SECTION_UNK] An Arbitral Award may be set aside by the [ORG] only if are imperative and take away the jurisdiction of the [ORG] to set aside an Award on any ground other than those specified in the Section. The [ORG] is not expected to sit in appeal over the findings of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] or to re appreciate evidence as an appellate court. [CARDINAL]. The petitioner has challenged the arbitral award in the grounds as set out in the petition and there is not even a whisper in the said grounds as to how they fall under the limited and narrow mandate of[ SECTION_UNK]. Even if the additional grounds under[ SECTION_UNK], as laid down by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in the case of ONGC vs [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], AIR 2003 SC 2629 are considered, which are patent illegality arising from statutory provisions or contract provisions or that the award shocks the conscience of the [ORG], no such facts are narrated in the petition. The endeavor of the petitioner is thus to convert the challenge to the arbitral award into an appellate proceeding involving a total re hearing of the matter and re appreciation of evidence, and which endeavor as per the consistent dicta of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] is impermissible in law. [CARDINAL]. [ORG] [ORG] heard both parties, examined documentary evidence, called for comments on facts and law from both parties and after hearing and affording full opportunities to make any statement of fact or law that the matter was decided and the award was fixed for publishing. Even if there is scope for [CARDINAL] interpretations of shareholders agreements and or clauses governing rights of the parties, yet it is fundamental law that court can not substitute its own views to that of [ORG] [ORG] because court is not functioning as a court of Appeal but is exercising its powers and jurisdiction subscribed by the act with limited scope. [CARDINAL]. The Award is not open to challenge on the ground that [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] has reached a wrong conclusion or that the interpretation given by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] to the provisions of the contract is not correct. The entire objections of the petitioner, as contained in the grounds, are contrary to the scheme of[ SECTION_UNK]. There is no averment in the petition as to the existence of any illegality that is apparent on the face of the arbitral award. The learned Arbitrator has actually decided the main disputes arisen between the parties and has the requisite direction while passing the award. [CARDINAL]. In the present case there is no error in the interpretation of the contract clauses by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. However even if it were to be assumed, the proper procedure for recording of evidence of witnesses was not followed by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], the same can not be set aside as the procedure followed by the learned Arbitrator with consent of parties as at that time no protest was raised by the petitioners. All the submissions of the petitioner in the present case are afterthought, there is no force in any submission which covers the scope of interference under[ SECTION_UNK]. The said pleas of the petitioners do not cover the preview of public policy. The contention of the respondents are correct even then this [ORG] would not interfere with O.M.P. [PERSON] the arbitral award for the reason that it is settled law that an error relatable to interpretation of the contract by an arbitrator is an error within his jurisdiction. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in the case of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] vs [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]., [DATE] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] has summarized the law on this point, in paragraph [CARDINAL] of the said judgment, as follows [CARDINAL]. Thus, there is no merit in the petition filed by the petitioner under[ SECTION_UNK]. The objections are dismissed. [CARDINAL]. No costs.

[DATE]. [CARDINAL]. In the present application, the following prayers have been made- [CARDINAL]. By way of this order, I shall dispose of both the aforesaid I.A.s i.e. [ORG] [ORG]. [DATE] filed by the [ORG] under Order XXXIX Rule 4 Code of Civil Procedure, [DATE] [DATE] and [GPE] no. [DATE] filed by the Plaintiffs under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 Code of Civil Procedure, [DATE] [DATE]. [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] Briefly stated, the present suit has been instituted by the [GPE] seeking grant of permanent injunction against the [ORG], in respect of the alleged infringement of their registered design, alongwith a prayer for delivery up, rendition of accounts and damages. Plaintiff no. [CARDINAL] is a Director of the Plaintiff no. [CARDINAL] company, however it is Plaintiff no. 1 whose proprietary rights in the registered design in question are alleged to have been infringed. Thus, for the sake of convenience, any reference to the Plaintiff in this order shall mean the [PERSON] collectively. [CARDINAL]. The [ORG] is a manufacturer of cable trays, which are stated to have application in various industries like [ORG] [ORG], [GPE], Bottling Plants, Metro Railways, [ORG], [GPE], High [PERSON] [PERSON], [ORG] [ORG], etc. It holds a registration under[ SECTION_UNK] of [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT], [DATE] [DATE] hereinafter referred to as the [ORG] since 05.03.2010. According to the [ORG], the design was registered as it was new, original and novel, which are the pre requisites for registration under[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act. The Plaintiff further claims that its registered design has acquired a secondary meaning in the market. [CARDINAL]. By way of the suit, the [ORG] has alleged that the [ORG] are manufacturing and selling a product which is an imitation of the [GPE] subject matter registered design. It has further been averred that the imitation by CS COMM 262/2020 the Defendants of the Plaintiffs registered design is in bad faith, since [ORG] are the [GPE] erstwhile distributors for the same product, i.e. the product which is the subject matter of the suit. It has also been averred that being ex distributors of the [ORG], the [ORG] were aware of the fact of registration and in spite of this knowledge, the adoption was carried out deliberately and consciously. [CARDINAL]. Earlier, vide order dated [DATE], an interim injunction was granted in favor of the [ORG] and in response, the [ORG] have filed the present application. The [ORG] have sought vacation of the interim order, [LOC] [LOC], on the following grounds [CARDINAL]. Since the [ORG] took objection to the grant of registration in favor of the Plaintiff on the grounds available under[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act, the suit was transferred to [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in terms of[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act from [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. In view thereof, this [ORG] must examine if the design in question qualified for registration under[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act on the parameters laid down in[ SECTION_UNK] thereof. At the outset, it is observed that since I am dealing with CS COMM 262/2020 applications under Order XXXIX Rule 1 and 2 Code of Civil Procedure, [DATE] [DATE] and Order XXXIX Rule 4 Code of Civil Procedure, [DATE] [DATE], the enquiry must be restricted to forming a prima facie view at this stage. [CARDINAL]. The thrust of the [ORG] objection regarding the registrability of the [GPE] design is largely on its prior publication, which according to the [ORG], disqualified it for registration under[ SECTION_UNK]b of the Act and now that it has been registered, it is liable for cancellation of registration under[ SECTION_UNK]b thereof. [CARDINAL]. The contention raised is that prior publication made the design old and commonplace as against being novel, new or original and therefore not eligible for registration. In [GPE] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] v. [PERSON] [PERSON] reported as [DATE] SCC OnLine Del 3582, the following observation has been made with respect to the criteria of prior publication- [CARDINAL]. Whilst the onus to establish that a design put up for registration under[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act is new, original or novel is on the applicant seeking its registration, once the registration is granted, the onus shifts on to the challenger, who challenges the grant of registration on any of the grounds available under[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act. If the challenge to claimed newness of a design is on the ground of prior publication, the onus rests on the challenger to demonstrate prior existence of the design by way of prior publication. In Bharat Glass Tube Limited v. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] reported as 2008 [CARDINAL] SCC 657, it has been observed that the onus to prove objections against the registrability of a design on the ground of[ SECTION_UNK]b of the Act rests with the challenger. [CARDINAL]. In the light of this dictum, it is to be seen if the [ORG] have discharged the onus sufficiently at this interim stage of examination to cast a doubt on the Plaintiffs registered design. [CARDINAL]. In support of their allegation of prior publication, the [ORG] have relied upon the following material [DATE]. Based on the aforesaid material, I am not inclined to agree with the [ORG] contention of prior publication of the design in question. Closely analysing the above material, I have noticed the following. [CARDINAL]. In para [CARDINAL] of the NEMA Standards Publication VE [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and VE 2- 2006 [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT] [EVENT], it is mentioned that These guidelines and information do not intend to cover all the details or variations in cable tray systems nor provide for every possible installation contingency. This clarification in the standard clearly establishes that even NEMA acknowledges that there could be several variations in the design of cable trays. Thus, [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] Publication VE [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] and VE 2- 2006 seem to be generic [ORG] [ORG] for installing cable trays. The illustrations in the said standard seem to offer a practical guidance to install cable tray system with the use of different installation components. Be that as it may, the illustrations do CS COMM 262/2020 not seem to be of the same design as that of the [ORG]. They appear to be a generic design comprising of a grid like metallic structure. [CARDINAL]. The [ORG] have next made a reference to the [PERSON] website, which has been disputed by the Plaintiff on the ground that [GPE] is another manufacturer of cable trays, and the availability on its website of cable tray illustrations does not establish prior publication of the [GPE] product. The web pages taken from [GPE] website and videos nowhere show commonality of design between the [GPE] design and that of [GPE]. There is no [PERSON] product in the references filed by the [ORG], with the configuration pattern AST C x B x D, which is the unique feature of the [GPE] design, as claimed by them. [CARDINAL]. The [ORG] have also relied on Internet Archive Wayback machine web pages, which is opposed by the Plaintiff for want of credibility. The [ORG] has referred to an affidavit dated [ORG], filed in proceedings pertaining to Patent no. D517789 before [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], by Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON], Manager of the Internet Archive, which created the way back machine. This affidavit is stated to be to the effect [DATE] [DATE]. Reference given by the Defendants of the [PERSON] videos featuring cable trays does not establish prior publication either. In none of the videos, the design details of the cable trays are discernible. The videos appear to be demonstration videos showing how to install cable trays. They do not highlight the design features. Plainly from the videos, neither the design features can be CS COMM 262/2020 discerned nor is it established that the videos predate the registration of the subject matter design of the [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. Likewise, the [ORG] reliance on their sale invoices claiming sale of cable trays even prior to the [GPE] registration of their design in [DATE] does not fully establish prior use or publication of the subject matter design by the [ORG]. The invoices relied upon only indicate that cable trays were sold by the [ORG] however they do not show that what was sold was the same subject matter design as that of the [ORG]. The invoices do not have any design of the cable tray printed on them nor do they bear any identification number to show that what was sold by the [ORG] was the same design as the subject matter design of the [ORG]. Further, the [ORG] has questioned the authenticity of the invoices by contending that the dates and the contents of the invoices are in different fonts. The Plaintiffs suggestion is that the invoices are fabricated, and hence should not be relied upon at this stage. [CARDINAL]. Besides the aforesaid material, during supplementary submissions, the [ORG] produced a cable tray claiming it to be a Cablofil product. However, the Plaintiff objected to such reference by the Defendants on the ground that the product was not placed on record earlier, nor was it accompanied by any invoice or sale information to establish its identity. According to the [ORG], it can not be identified who was the manufacturer of the said product, much less [ORG], and if the same has been in existence prior to the registered design of the [ORG]. There is substance in the [GPE] objections. Mere production of the product in the [ORG] without any supporting documents does not establish prior publication as alleged by the [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. The [ORG] has claimed that its design satisfies both pre requisites for registration, i.e. novelty and originality, due to its unique design specifications that distinguish its design from other designs of cable trays in the market. It is CS COMM 262/2020 further claimed that the configuration pattern of its subject matter AST C x B x D with design and shape formed by longitudinal and latitudinal grid like rod placements, center locating of the horizontal rods on the collar rods and specific bending angle and radii at junction points etc. are all features of the subject matter design, which is a novelty and unique to this design. According to the [ORG], AST C x B x D stands for a design configuration where C denotes collar width in [PERSON], B denotes width of the cable tray in mm, and D denotes rod thickness. [CARDINAL]. In [GPE] Benckiser Supra the words original and new have been characterized as following [CARDINAL]. As observed in the above case, a new design is distinct from an original design. A design may not be new, but still it can be original considering the manner in which it is applied for the [ORDINAL] time. In the present case, the [ORG] have questioned the newness of the [GPE] subject matter design by claiming that a grid like metallic construct of cable trays is commonplace and not new, hence it could not have been registered in the [ORDINAL] place as proscribed under[ SECTION_UNK]a of the Act. On the other hand, the [ORG] has claimed both newness and originality of its subject matter design. [CARDINAL]. As defined in[ SECTION_UNK]d of the Act, the expression design means only the features of shape, configuration, pattern, ornament of composition of lines or colors, applied to any article, whether in [CARDINAL] dimensional or [CARDINAL] dimensional, which in the finished article appeal to and are judged solely by the eye. Therefore, it is the visual manifestation of a form that is recognized as proprietary right of its creator and adaptor. Form factor of a particular product can be common to various products of the same category, but within the commonness, there can be distinguishing features that make a design new or original, setting it apart from other designs visually. On these lines, the [ORG] in Bharat Glass Tube Limited Supra has also observed that a design can be new or original due to its new application that did not exist earlier. [CARDINAL]. From the foregoing, it follows that design under the [ORG] is not about the mode or principle of construction or process of construction. It is the visual appeal of a design that is laid down as a test to judge if a design is novel or original. This visual or ocular test has been recognised by Courts time to time in various decisions. Reference may be taken, for instance, of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] v. [ORG] [ORG] and Others reported as 2014 3 HCC Del [CARDINAL], where the ocular test was applied to decide the issue at hand. [CARDINAL]. In the present case, the imitation of the Plaintiffs design by the [ORG] is visually apparent. The [ORG] has drawn a comparison of the [CARDINAL] products in its rejoinder and has illustratively shown the similarity between the [CARDINAL]. As per the comparison, the measurements, the spacing between the latitudinal and longitudinal rods to form a grid, the dimensions of the length, breadth and height of the trays, in the [ORG] product, are all exact replica of the [GPE] product. The [ORG] has also filed a report of a design expert wherein a comprehensive comparison of the Plaintiffs and the Defendants products has been carried out. According to this report, the [ORG] product is an exact copy of the [GPE] product. As a matter of fact, the [ORG] have not denied the similarity of their product with that of the Plaintiffs but, have challenged the Plaintiffs proprietary claim over the impugned design on the ground of its prior publication. I have no reason to discount the expert opinion at this stage of enquiry. The [ORG] objection to the expert opinion is on the credibility of a paid expert, otherwise on the merits of the expert opinion, the [ORG] objections are feeble. It is clarified that I am not persuaded by the expert report on the question of newness of the subject design, for which I have relied upon my own visual judgment. Expert opinion has been considered by this [ORG] only for the purpose of comparison of the [ORG] product with that of the Plaintiffs. [CARDINAL]. It is also noteworthy that the burden of proof was on the [ORG] to prove that the [GPE] product is not new or original. Regardless, they have not furnished any cogent material in support of their contention. The [ORG] have also failed to bely the [GPE] averment that the [ORG] are its erstwhile distributors, which fact assumes importance in view of [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] v. [PERSON] [PERSON] and [ORG]. reported as 2015 SCC OnLine CS COMM 262/2020 Del 10139 where the [ORG] was not inclined to decide in favor of the defendants under similar facts and circumstances and made the following observations- [CARDINAL]. I may, at this stage, add that the judgments relied upon by the [ORG] in support of their submissions do not serve the [ORG] cause. A perusal of the decisions in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and Bharat Glass Tube Limited Supra, relied upon by the [ORG], would show that they rather support the [GPE] contentions. The [ORG] also rely on [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] v. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] reported as 2004 SCC OnLine Cal [CARDINAL], which dealt with the definition of publish for the purpose of[ SECTION_UNK]a of the Act. In the captioned case, [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] had filed a suit for injuncting [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] from infringing its registered design of a footwear. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] COMM 262/2020 Pvt. Ltd. opposed the injunction by claiming prior publication of the design in question by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in its promotional material. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] contended that the promotion material could not treated as prior publication as it was not published for the purposes of public circulation but was meant to be used for the purpose of promotion. In this backdrop, a [PERSON] of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] ruled in favour of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] holding that even if the promotional material in question was not meant for public circulation, yet the same will be construed as prior publication for the purposes of[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act. However, in the present case, the issue is not whether publication alleged by the [ORG] to be prior will constitute prior publication or not but whether the design in question being commonplace and published freely attracts disqualification under[ SECTION_UNK]b of the Act or not. Thus, the reliance sought to be placed on [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] Supra is misplaced. Similarly, the decision in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] v. Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON] Mana Da Trading reported as 2009 SCC OnLine Del [DATE], relied upon by the [ORG], is not applicable to the facts of the present case. In the said case, the [ORG], while subjectively applying the eye test, ruled that the design in question was not new. In terms of the above decision, it is for this [ORG] to apply the eye test and see if the design is significantly distinguishing from known designs. [CARDINAL]. The [ORG] objection to the territorial jurisdiction of this [ORG] has no merit either. The [ORG] has claimed jurisdiction of this [ORG] under[ SECTION] [DATE]. The [ORG] has filed evidence of sale of the offending product by the Defendants on [ORDINAL] party, [ORG] [ORG] website like [ORG], which is a universally accessible website and is accessible in [GPE] too. The law on the issue of territorial jurisdiction in the case of online sale and purchase of goods is settled. This Court in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] v. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] Another reported as [DATE] SCC OnLine Del [DATE] while relying on the decision of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [PERSON] of this Court in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] v. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON]. reported as 2009 SCC OnLine Del [DATE] and [ORG] ordinate [PERSON] in [ORG] [ORG] v. Mr. [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON]. reported as 2018 SCC OnLine Del [DATE] held that [GPE] situated in places where infringing goods can be purchased through [ORDINAL] party, [ORG] [ORG] websites will have jurisdiction to try offences relating to infringement of trademark. The same principle will apply in case of suits filed against infringement of design under the Act. [CARDINAL]. Moreover, the jurisdiction of this [ORG] to interfere with an interlocutory or temporary injunction is purely equitable. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] has also opined thus in [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and Others reported as [DATE] 5 SCC [CARDINAL]. Relevant excerpt from the case is reproduced hereunder- 31. It is noted that the [ORG] have not fully satisfied this Court on their own conduct. Defendants have opposed the injunction order, questioning the CS COMM 262/2020 Plaintiffs impugned design, on the ground that the same is not new or original due to prior publication of the said design. However, it is too much of a coincidence that the [ORG] offending product is an exact copy of the [GPE] subject matter design down to the last detail. Even the measurement and dimensions demonstrably appear to be the same. Further, the [ORG] have raised a contention that grid like metallic design is a design common to cable trays. Even if the contention is accepted, the same did not entitle the [ORG] to copy the [GPE] product as it is. It would have been a different case if the [ORG] had adopted their own design and defended the same by claiming it to be distinguished from the [GPE] design. As stated above, no such attempt has been made by the [ORG] and rather the similarity with the [GPE] design is candidly admitted. The allegation that the [ORG] are ex distributors of the [ORG] and that their product is an exact copy of the [GPE] product, is not denied. In view of the above, the [ORG] adoption of the [GPE] design appears to be dishonest and therefore they have failed to satisfy this [ORG] on equity. [CARDINAL]. For the reasons stated, no case is made out for vacation of the injunction order dated [CARDINAL]. Consequently, [ORG] [ORG]. [DATE] filed by the [ORG] is dismissed and [GPE] no. [DATE] filed by the [ORG] is disposed of by making the injunction order dated [CARDINAL] absolute. [CARDINAL]. By way of abundant caution, it is clarified that the observations made hereinabove are prima facie in nature and shall not prejudice the respective rights and contentions of the parties at the time of final disposal of the suit.

Besides this, the petitioner in respect of his cancer treatment is undergoing regular [ORG]. The petitioner is praying for bail since the offences are non bailable in nature. It is further stated that [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. [ORG] [ORG] has issued NBWs against the petitioner vide order dated [DATE] despite the fact that no summons were received by the petitioner. The petitioner has apprehension of his arrest pursuant to the issuance of NBWs issued against him and the next date of hearing is [DATE] [DATE] [CARDINAL].

[ORG] [ORG] had, however, appeared in the court and informed the petitioner about the issuance of NBWs against him. [CARDINAL]. The petitioner had thereafter engaged a counsel who downloaded the order from the concerned internet portal of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] which confirmed the issuance of NBWs against him. Ld. Sr. counsel has submitted that the petitioner was not arrested during investigation and there is no legal justification for issuance of NBWs against him. The petitioner has apprehension that he will be sent to custody upon appearance before the [ORG]. [ORG] Special Judge [PERSON] [PERSON], [DATE] [DATE]. It is, therefore, submitted that NBWs issued vide order dated [DATE] against the petitioner is unjustified and without any basis. The summons were never served upon the petitioner. Only a submission has been made by [ORG] that the petitioner was aware about the development of the case and deliberately avoiding his appearance before the [ORG].

[ORG] Special Judge [PERSON] [PERSON], [DATE] [DATE] was of the opinion that petitioner was deliberately evading his appearance, the [ORG]. [ORG] Special Judge [PERSON] [PERSON], [DATE] [DATE] ought to have issued bailable warrants in the [ORDINAL] instance. Issuance of NBWs by the [ORG]. [ORG] Special Judge [PERSON] [PERSON], [DATE] [DATE] is contrary to law laid down by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. Ld. Counsel for the petitioner has relied upon Inder [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON]. v State of Uttaranchal Ors. reported in [DATE] [CARDINAL] SCC 1. It is further submitted that investigation in the instant case has already been completed. Since the petitioner was not arrested during investigation, there is no ground for the SFIO to oppose the bail or seek custody before the [PRODUCT]. [ORG] Special Judge [PERSON] [PERSON], [DATE] [DATE]. Ld. Counsel for the petitioner has also relied upon [ORG] on its Own Motion v. [ORG], reported in [CARDINAL] 2003 DLT 494 and [ORG] on its Own Motion v. State, reported in [CARDINAL] 2017 DLT 373DB. It is submitted that petitioner is aged and needs constant medical support. It is further submitted that since the investigation is complete and no recovery is to be effected at [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. [DATE] the instance of the petitioner, no useful purpose would be served by sending the petitioner to jail. It is submitted that in similar circumstances, another [PERSON] of this court has granted relief to similarly placed co accused Sh. Brij [PERSON] [PERSON] in [ORG] [ORG] no. [DATE] vide [ORG] dt. [DATE]. It is submitted that there are [CARDINAL] accused persons and prosecution has relied upon record running into [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] of pages. Proceedings in such cases are likely to take time. The petitioner has never made any attempt to influence the witnesses, tamper with documentary evidence or in any other manner, hampered the investigation or judicial process. He has never evaded the process of law. He undertakes to be bound by the conditions imposed upon him by the court and he be, therefore, released in the event of his arrest. [CARDINAL]. It is further argued by [ORG]. Sr. counsel that twin conditions for grant of bail described under[ SECTION_UNK] of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW], [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] are not applicable for the purpose of adjudication of the anticipatory bail application. The said conditions are only applicable during regular bail proceedings of accused arrested by the [ORG] under [ORG] [ORG] no. [DATE][ SECTION]. In this regards, the petitioner has relied upon the following cases- 8. It is, therefore, prayed that petitioner be granted anticipatory bail in the event of his arrest in the complaint case in question pending before the court of [ORG]. [ORG] Special Judge [PERSON] [PERSON], [DATE] [DATE]. [CARDINAL]. The anticipatory bail application is opposed by Ms. [PERSON] [PERSON], [ORG]. ASG for the State on the ground that the allegations against the petitioner are very serious in nature. A fraud has been committed to the tune of rs. [CARDINAL] Crores approximately. A complaint has been filed against the petitioner for the offences punishable under[ SECTION]. Ld. ASG has further argued that [ORG] [ORG] had granted bail to [CARDINAL] co accused [ORG] [ORG] no. 2693/2019 Nitin Johri. However, the said bail order has been stayed by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. Ld. ASG has further argued that petitioner is supposed to approach the [PRODUCT]. [ORG] Special Judge [PERSON] [PERSON], [DATE] [DATE] for cancellation of NBWs as well as for grant of bail. All the submissions made by the [ORG]. Sr. Counsel before this [ORG] should be made before the court of [ORG]. [ORG] Special Judge [PERSON] [PERSON], [DATE] [DATE]. She has, therefore prayed for dismissal of the bail application. [CARDINAL]. I have considered the rival submissions. The allegations levelled against the petitioner are prima facie serious in nature. The allegations are that petitioner was [CARDINAL] of the signatories of the financials of A-1 company and Director in category [ORG] [ORG]. The details of the same have been described in the summoning order dated [CARDINAL] of the [PRODUCT]. [ORG] Special Judge [PERSON] [PERSON], [DATE] [DATE]. It is alleged that petitioner has signed forged letter of credits and other documents for availing credit facility from the Bank on behalf of [ORG] [ORG]. Thus, prima facie there are serious allegations of fraud committed by the petitioner in conspiracy with other co accuseds. Perusal of the ordersheet dated [DATE] of [ORG]. Special Judge reveals that some co accuseds have appeared before the [ORG]. [ORG] Bail Appl no. [DATE] Special Judge and moved an application for seeking bail. Ld. Counsel for the [ORG] has accepted notice and sought time to file reply to the said bail application. So far as petitioner [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] is concerned, as per report of the Process Server, he was not available at the given address. Ld. Counsel for the [ORG] had submitted that petitioner accused was very well aware about the development of the case and was intentionally avoiding his appearance before the [ORG]. In these circumstances, NBWs were issued against him. [CARDINAL]. Per [ORG], ld. Counsel for the petitioner has argued that summons were not properly served upon the petitioner. According to the [ORG]. Counsel, service was to be effected upon some adult male member of the family of the petitioner. However, in the present case the service was not affected on any adult male member and in case the petitioner was not available, the service could have been affected by affixation as per[ SECTION]. Thus, the [PRODUCT]. [ORG] Special Judge [PERSON] [PERSON], [DATE] [DATE] has not followed the provisions of Code of Criminal Procedure, [DATE]. [CARDINAL]. Perusal of para no. 8 i of the petition reveals that Ld. Counsel for the petitioner was not able to inspect the judicial record. It, therefore, can not be said as to what was the report of process serving [ORG] [ORG] no. [DATE] agency on the summons issued to the petitioner. Without seeing the copy of the report on summons, it can not be said whether petitioner was properly served or not. This submission is, therefore, made without seeing the record. In case, the petitioner is correct to the extent that he was not duly served, the [ORG]. ASJ Special Judge after considering the submission of Ld. Counsel for petitioner and [ORG]. counsel for [ORG] and perusal of report on summon can pass the appropriate order in accordance with law. In these circumstances, it will be appropriate for the petitioner to approach the [PRODUCT]. ASJ Special Judge and make all his submissions made herein, before the [ORG]. Trial court as well. However, no doubt there is a reasonable apprehension that before the petitioner is able to approach the Ld. [ORG] [ORG], he may be arrested by prosecuting agency in pursuance of NBWs issued against him. In the opinion of this [ORG], the petitioner need to be protected to that extent and it is, therefore, ordered that till next date of hearing i.e. 11.11.2019, the NBWs issued by [ORG]. [ORG] Special Judge be kept in abeyance. [CARDINAL]. Now coming to the question of grant of anticipatory bail, keeping in mind the serious nature of the offence where there are Bail Appl no. [DATE] grave allegations of fraud involving huge amount of money running in crores of rupees, no grounds for anticipatory bail to the petitioner are made out. [CARDINAL]. It is a settled law that[ SECTION] being an extraordinary remedy has to be exercised sparingly and more so in cases of economic offences as these offences affect the economic fiber of the society. In [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] Kumar Jain, [DATE] 2 SCC [CARDINAL], [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] has held that in economic offences, the accused is not entitled to anticipatory bail. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in State of [ORG] vs Mohanlal [PERSON] [PERSON] and [PERSON]., [DATE] 2 SCC 364 has held that economic offenders ruin the economy and has observed as [DATE] [DATE]. In view of the above law laid down by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and keeping in mind the facts and circumstances of the case and serious nature of offence and amount of cheating involved as well as allegation of forgery, no grounds for anticipatory bail are made out. The NBWs issued against the petitioner be, however, kept in abeyance till [DATE] [DATE] of hearing i.e. 11.11.2019 before the [ORG]. [ORG] Special Judge [PERSON] [PERSON], [DATE] [DATE]. Let the petitioner appear before the court concerned and move an application for cancellation of NBWs and grant of bail which will be considered by [ORG]. [ORG] Special Judge uninfluenced by the observations made by this [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. The anticipatory bail application is disposed of accordingly.

      " [CARDINAL]. Following [CARDINAL] questions were formulated by this Court in the reference petition filed by the department and the [ORG] was directed to prepare and transmit the statement of case based thereupon- [CARDINAL]. In so far as [ORDINAL] question is concerned, learned counsel for the assessee has drawn our attention to the judgment of [ORG] [ORG] in the case of CIT Vs. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [CARDINAL] [ORG] 485 which squarely answered the question in affirmative i.e. in favour of the assessee and against the revenue. [CARDINAL]. [ORDINAL] question relates to the claim of the assessee for deduction under[ SECTION_UNK] of [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] in respect of its new unit namely [QUANTITY] [QUANTITY] [ORG] [ORG] and Steel Unit B. This case pertains to [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. Perusal of the order of the Assessing Officer would reveal that for the [ORDINAL] time, claim under[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act was made by the assessee in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] 1973- 74. The assessee was denied that claim by the Assessing Officer. For this reason, the Assessing Officer denied the claim in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] as well, taking note of the fact that the matter pertaining to [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] was pending before [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. It is a matter of record that the appeal filed by the assessee for [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] 1973- 74 was allowed by the [ORG]. The effect thereof was that the assessee was granted the requisite deduction under[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act for the assessment year [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. The [ORG] has sought reference under[ SECTION_UNK] 1 of the Act which reference application was also rejected by the [ORG]. Likewise, for the assessment [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], the claims of the assessee were allowed. The assessee, once given the deduction under[ SECTION_UNK] of the Act is entitled to such a deduction for [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. If the assessee has been allowed the benefit of[ SECTION_UNK] in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], there is no reason to deny the same for the instant [ORG] [CARDINAL] OF [DATE] assessment year. We, therefore, answer this issue also in favour of the assessee and against the revenue. [CARDINAL]. As far as question [CARDINAL] is concerned, the same arises in the following factual background The assessee had challenged the fixation of price by the Government for sale of levy sugar under [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] by filing a writ petition in the High Court of Allahabad. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] granted interim order in favour of the assessee. However, this order was subject to the condition that in case the writ petition is ultimately decided against the assessee, the assessee will have to refund the excess amount charged alongwith the interest to be calculated [CARDINAL] per annum. Thus, in the relevant assessment year, the assessee had sold the levy sugar at a price in excess of the price fixed by the government and in this manner calculated the excess amount of rs. 1,02,037/-. The question is as to whether the receipt of this amount has to be treated as revenue receipt i.e. income at the hands of assessee or it has to be treated as contingent receipt which was the position taken by the assessee in the return filed by it. [CARDINAL]. The writ petition filed by the assessee was ultimately dismissed and the amount in question was refunded by the assessee alongwith the interest. Similar position, in the case of the assessee itself, had arisen in the assessment year 1975- 76 also. In [DATE] [DATE] too, the [ORG] had decided the issue in favour of the assessee holding that the excess price charged by the assessee, while the writ petition was still pending, would not be treated as a revenue receipt in the hands of the assessee company, in asmuch as, the excess receipt was contingent upon the success in the writ petition filed by the assessee. The said decision of the [ORG] was upheld by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] of ITR [CARDINAL] OF [DATE] Allahabad in CIT Vs. M s Modi Industries Ltd. Modi Nagar, [ORG] [CARDINAL] of 1989 in the following manner vide its decision dated 2.5.2007- 7. It is clear from the above that [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] followed its decision in [FAC] [FAC] [FAC] supra. We have been taken through the said judgment. In that case also, conditional stay order was granted in the writ petition filed by the respondent. The respondent in that case, vide interim order, was permitted to sell sugar at a price different from the price fixed by the government. However, condition was imposed upon the respondent to furnish bank guarantee before the Registrar of that Court in respect of the difference between the price fixed by the Government and the price at which the sugar was actually sold by the respondent. It was also made clear that it would be open to the court to deal with the bank guarantee and pass order as to how the amount is to be distributed at the time of final orders in the writ petition. Keeping in view that it was a conditional order passed by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in the writ petition challenging the fixation of the price levy sugar, [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] opined that the interim order was not unconditional and as it was hedged with certain condition, the excess price charged would not be treated as revenue receipt income at the hands of the assessee. [CARDINAL]. We may point out at this stage that the Supreme court in the case of [ORG] [ORG] Vs. CIT, [CARDINAL] [ORG] 421 had occasion to deal with such type of matter. In that case, however, [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] was concerned with the [ORG] [CARDINAL] OF [DATE] interim order passed by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] whereby operation of the Notification issued by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] was suspended during the pendency of the writ petition and the assessee was specifically permitted to sell the sugar at the rate prevailing prior to the impugned Notification. Taking note of the fact that no condition was imposed which passing such an order, [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] held that receipt of the excess amount would be treated as revenue receipt as it was not hedged with any condition. [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] specifically drew distinction between the interim orders passed by the Courts where the stay orders were not hedged with conditions and the orders which were conditional like the case of the assessee here and this distinction is discussed by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in the following words- 9. In [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] supra [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] took note of the aforesaid judgment of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] in [ORG] [ORG] supra and highlighted the distinction made by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG]. We may reproduce the following portion from that judgment for our benefit Applying the principles laid down by the apex court in the cases of [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] 2000 [CARDINAL] ITR 421 and [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [DATE] [CARDINAL] [ORG] 524 SC to the facts of the present case, we find that here also the right to collect realize extra levy sugar price was on account of the interim order dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], passed by this [ORG] which was hedged with certain conditions. Thus, the right to receive the payment had been in dispute. It, therefore, did not form part of the trading receipt of the respondent assessee. We are in respectful agreement with the earlier decision of this [ORG], which is inter partes relating to [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. In this view of the matter, we answer the [ORDINAL] question of the law in the affirmative, i.e. in favour of the assessee and against the revenue. [CARDINAL]. It is thus clear that in those cases where the interim orders are passed permitting the assessee to recover excess amount than the amount fixed by the government for levy sugar without any condition of refund etc., such receipt of these amounts would be treated as revenue receipt. [CARDINAL]. On the other hand, where conditions are imposed and particularly the condition that this amount would be refunded in case the petitioner fails in the writ petition, the excess realization at the hands of the assessee is not to be treated as revenue receipt but contingent receipt. Thus we answer this question also in favour of the assessee and against the revenue. [CARDINAL]. Question [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] which relates to the initial depreciation under[ SECTION_UNK] 1 iv of the Act. The relevant portion of[ SECTION_UNK] 1 iv is reproduced hereunder- [CARDINAL]. Admittedly, the term building is not defined under [LAW] [LAW] [LAW] [LAW]. Therefore, one will have to fall back on the meaning which is assigned to this term in common parlance. The [LANGUAGE] language dictionaries define the word building to mean any structure for whatsoever purpose and of whatsoever materials constructed and any part thereof, whether used as human habitation or not. Therefore, part of the structure is also known as building. This meaning should be taken alongwith the purpose for which the aforesaid provision was enacted, namely, to afford incentives to businesses to construct buildings for housing lowly paid employees. Providing such type of accommodation is now treated an important facet and part of corporate social responsibility. The avowed purpose of the aforesaid provision was to engage and inspire the corporate sector to discharge such social responsibility. [CARDINAL]. Having regard to these factors, we are of the opinion that the [ORG] rightly held that the assessee was entitled to initial deprecation under this ITR [CARDINAL] OF 1990 Section. We, thus, answer question no.4 in affirmative i.e. in favour of the assessee and against the revenue.

      " [CARDINAL]. In response to the directions contained in the order dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], the Registrar BIFR has produced through his counsel [TIME] of a meeting dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] drawn up by [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] [ORG], which read as under- [CARDINAL]. The communication dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] addressed to the petitioner by Secretary [PERSON] informs that reference made by the petitioner under[ SECTION_UNK] of [GPE], [DATE] has been registered as Case no.21/2016 and therefore the petitioner company is restrained from disposing of or alienating the fixed assets of the petitioner without the prior consent of [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. Whilst it may be a starting point of a decision that a sick company in respect whereof reference has been admitted should not dispose of its fixed W.P.C no.1127/2016 assets pending consideration whether a scheme of rehabilitation, but a judicial decision has to be taken on that aspect of the matter in view of[ SECTION_UNK] of [GPE], [DATE] which requires [ORG] to form an opinion that in public interest a sick industrial company should be restrained from disposing of its fixed assets pending consideration of a scheme for revival. [CARDINAL]. It is settled law that where a statute vests a power and prescribes a manner of exercise thereof, the power has to be exercised in the manner prescribed and in no other way. [CARDINAL].[ SECTION_UNK] of [ORG] reads as under- [CARDINAL]. A perusal thereof shows that the [ORG] has to form an opinion keeping in view public interest or the interest of the sick industrial company or its creditors or shareholders that the sick company should not dispose of its assets without the permission of the [ORG]. The decision being statutory would require [ORG] to consider all the relevant facts and pass an order W.P.C [NORP] bringing out the public interest or the interest of the sick industrial company or its creditors or shareholders which needs to be protected by restraining the sick industrial company from selling its fixed assets. This decision can not be in the nature of a general administrative decision flowing through a practice direction issued in a meeting of [ORG] which is an administrative meeting and not a meeting of BIFR discharging quasi judicial functions or statutory functions of [ORG].

The writ petition is accordingly disposed of quashing the direction in the letter dated [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] addressed by Registrar BIFR to the petitioner that it would not dispose of or alienate its fixed assets for the reason [FAC] [FAC] [FAC] has communicated said facts in terms of the administrative decision taken in [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] by [ORG].

PW-1, [PERSON] [PERSON], an independent material witness, lives on the [ORDINAL] floor of the building in which the accused persons are residing.

PW-1 told the accused persons to bring down the body whereupon the accused [PERSON] cut the chunni and brought down the dead body and kept it on the bed. PW-1 tried to revive the deceased by pressing her chest while accused [ORG] gave her mouth to mouth resuscitation. PW-1 informed the police.

PW-2 to [CARDINAL] are the father, mother, brother and sister of the deceased, made material improvements in their deposition made Bail App.no.1036/2013 before the [ORG] vis- à- vis the statement made to the police SDM earlier. They were confronted with their previous statements at the time of cross examination. The following improvements were made by the aforesaid witnesses-- The demand of more gifts was made on [GPE] as the gifts were not enough to distribute among relatives on [GPE].- The mother in- law taunted [PERSON] that her family just came to have dinner on her birthday without any gifts for them On the occasion of [PERSON] [PERSON], the mother in- law was not happy on seeing the fruits, clothes and cash sent by the father of the deceased and she questioned the deceased what [ORG] saw in [GPE] and that she could get [CARDINAL] others like her for [ORG].- The deceased was beaten up by her husband on the road and that the deceased came to her parents house and [DATE] [DATE] [DATE], the petitioner with [ORG] came to the parents house and apologized and assured that demands of car and bikes would not be made and took the deceased back.- Three to four months after the marriage, on [PERSON] [PERSON] suits, diamond ring and [ORG] were given to Payal and [ORG] whereupon Payals brothers in- law argued and quarreled with her that they had not got anything for them.- The petitioner, his wife and [ORG] demanded [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] and brothers in- law demanded motor cycles.- PW-4 took dry fruits, sweets, [PERSON] for [ORG], rs.1,100/- for other family members and a fully automatic washing [ORG] [ORG] machine on [GPE] to which the mother in- law quarreled with [PERSON] about gold coins and clothes not being given and that PW 4 assured that the same would be given [TIME] [TIME]. [CARDINAL]. The defence set up by the accused in the cross examination of the six witnesses is that [ORG] and [PERSON] were having a love affair for [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] and- a half years Payals father came to know of the said love affair [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] [CARDINAL] before the marriage Gauravs family approached Payals family for marriage in pursuance to which [ORG] and [PERSON] got married on [DATE] [DATE], [DATE] Payal was insisting her husband to separate from the joint family house immediately to which [ORG] was not agreeable as he wanted to separate after [PERSON] [PERSON] was a stubborn, aggressive and emotional girl Payal wanted to lead an independent modern life with her husband separate from her in laws Payal attempted to commit suicide twice before Payal purchased Phenyl for committing suicide if [ORG] did not separate from the joint family Payal committed suicide because of her obstinacy for shifting immediately Payals sister also threatened to commit suicide as she did not want to stay with her husband the accused persons have furniture showrooms at [PERSON] [PERSON], [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART] [WORK_OF_ART], [PERSON] [PERSON], a house at Anarkali and a plot allotted by [ORG] at [GPE] besides the [CARDINAL] sq. [PERSON] [PERSON] at [ORG] [ORG] the interior decoration of the house of accused was done by [PERSON] the relationship between [PERSON] and the accused were cordial the atmosphere at the joint family house was calm and cordial photographs show [PERSON] being happy with [ORG] and the Bail App.no.1036/2013 other accused persons in various events [PERSON] is shown feeding cake to [GPE] in a clipping of Himanshus one of the co accused and brother in- law of [NORP] birthday on [DATE] [DATE], [DATE] Payal stayed with her mother in- law for her cataract operation at [FAC] [FAC] [FAC] [FAC] for [DATE] [DATE] the complainant and his family have leveled false allegations against the accused persons regarding demand of dowry and torture out of emotion and vengeance the complainant engaged a private counsel from the very beginning the complainants family gave statements to the police after consulting a lawyer and taking advise from the police. [CARDINAL]. In [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] v. State, 2010 [CARDINAL] DLT [CARDINAL], this [ORG] noted that whenever a woman dies an unnatural death within seven years of her marriage at in laws house, whatever be the cause of death, the parents of the deceased want the in laws to be hanged. This [ORG] observed truth is losing significance because of the ego of the litigants to see that in laws should be hanged. This [ORG] further observed that normally in laws are convicted on the testimonies of parents of the girl who, in a fit of anger or because they had lost their daughter, are not prepared to believe that their daughter could commit suicide for any other reason. The testimony given by the complainant in such cases is not a normal testimony. The deceaseds father and other family members who deposed in the court testified after the death of their daughter and their testimony is coloured with the loss they suffered due to sudden death of the daughter little realizing that she committed Bail App.no.1036/2013 suicide not because of dowry demands but could be because of her fragile and sensitive nature. This [ORG] further observed that suicide is a known phenomenon of human nature. Suicides are committed by living human beings for various reasons, some are not able to bear the normal stresses which are common in life some are not able to cope up with the circumstances in which they are placed and some commit suicide because of frustration of not achieving the desired goals. There are many cases where students commit suicide because they failed to achieve certain percentage of marks. Some commit suicide because they are not able to retain top position, some commit suicide because they are not able to cope with the demands of life. Some commit suicide because they suffer sudden loss, some commit suicide out of fear of being caught. There are various reasons for which suicides are committed by men and women. All suicides are unnatural deaths. Suicide is a complex phenomenon. [CARDINAL], who commits suicide, is not alive to disclose as to what was going on in his or her mind when he or she committed suicide. There is no presumption that every suicide committed by a married woman in her in laws house or at her parents house has to be because she was suffering harassment at the hands of her husband or her in laws. [CARDINAL]. In [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON] [PERSON], [CARDINAL] [DATE] DLT [PRODUCT], this [ORG] observed that no doubt, an unnatural death is always a cause for concern and if proved that the daughter in- law of the family was compelled to take her own life as it was rendered not worth Bail App.no.1036/2013 living by the in laws, they must suffer. But personal liberties have to be preserved, meaning thereby, in an appropriate case, accused has to be set free till trial concludes. [CARDINAL]. On careful examination of the statements of the [CARDINAL] witnesses, this [ORG] is of the prima facie view that although it is difficult to say ultimately what shape the trial would take after completion of the entire evidence, but if ultimately it is found on evidence that [PERSON] was a very sensitive person and committed suicide because she could not bear the pressure of living in joint family, the possibility of the petitioner succeeding in establishing their defence can not be ruled out. [CARDINAL]. The petitioner as well as [CARDINAL] other family members namely, his wife and [CARDINAL] sons including the husband of the deceased are in custody since [DATE] [DATE] [DATE] [DATE]. [CARDINAL]. The petitioner himself had informed the complainant about the demise of Payal without any delay. [CARDINAL]. There was no ante mortem injury on the body of the deceased. [CARDINAL]. There is no possibility of the petitioner influencing any witness since the statements of the [CARDINAL] material witnesses have already been recorded by the learned [ORG] [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. There is no material to show that if released on bail, the petitioner will misuse the liberty granted to him to subvert the justice. [CARDINAL]. In view of the aforesaid, the bail application is allowed and the petitioner is ordered to be released on bail on his furnishing Bail App.no.1036/2013 personal bond in the sum of [GPE] with [CARDINAL] surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the concerned [ORG]. The petitioner is directed to surrender his passport, if any, with [ORG] [ORG] [ORG] and he shall not leave the country without prior permission of the [ORG]. [CARDINAL]. All observations made hereinabove for the purpose of dealing with the bail application and shall not be considered at the time of trial of the case. [CARDINAL]. Dasti.
