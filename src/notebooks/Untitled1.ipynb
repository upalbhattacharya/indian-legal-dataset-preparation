       "'\\n\\n\\n\\n 1.      The appellant is aggrieved by the decision of the learned Single Judge\\ndated 30.03.2016, by which its writ petition was dismissed. Its claim in the\\nwrit petition was that the refusal to cover an event, which had been insured,\\nis arbitrary and unreasonable.\\n\\n\\n 2.      The appellant, a private company is engaged in event management\\nbusiness.     On 13.09.2010, a letter was issued to one M/s. Prerana\\nInternational by the Goa Cricket Association in pursuance of a tender floated\\n \\n  LPA No.354/2016                                             Page 1 of 21\\n \\n by it, granting \"instadia\" advertising rights for the cricket match to be played\\nbetween India and Australia on 24.10.2010.On 24.09.2010 itself, M/s.\\nPrerana entered into an Instadia Advertising Agreementwith the appellant by\\nsub-contracting its rights as a successful bidder, to the appellant. The\\nappellant, on 15.10.2010 entered into an insurance contract agreement\\npolicy with New India Assurance Company Limited (hereafter \"insurer\") to\\ncover for the loss of revenue for the matches to be played during the India\\nversus Australia One Day International (ODI) series from 17.10.2010 till\\n24.10.2010 (this included both the match at Goa to be played on 24.10.2010\\nas well as the match to be played at Kochi on 17.10.2010).\\n\\n\\n 3.     The petitioner paid the premium amount of â‚¹3,24,284/-. The insurer\\nthereafter provided the appellant with the terms and conditions of the policy.\\nOn 17.10.2010, the ODI to be held at Kochi was called off due to heavy\\nrain. The appellant accordingly claimed insurance cover with the insurer\\ninvoking the clause of the insurance document, which covered the standard\\nfire and special perils, including cover for rain causing cancellation of the\\nmatch. It appears that this claim was duly settled between the parties and the\\ninsurer paid the appellant the sum that was due as the insurance amount. At\\nthe same time however, on 18.10.2010, the insurer sent an endorsement to\\nthe petitioner which stated:\\n\\n\\n \"Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, it\\n       is hereby declared and agreed that the perils of storm, cyclone,\\n       typhoon, tempest, hurricane, tornado, flood, inundation, rains,\\n       bad pitch conditions and wet ground conditions are hereby\\n       deleted from the scope of within mentioned policy for Goa ODI\\n       match to be played on 24.10.2010.\"\\n\\n\\n LPA No.354/2016                                              Page 2 of 21\\n\\n\\n On 24.10.2010, the ODI at Goa also got cancelled due to heavy rain.\\n\\n\\n The petitioner on 25.10.2010 wrote a letter to the insurer requesting it to\\nsettle the claim under the policy. The insurer vide letter dated 27.10.2010\\nrejected the claim of the appellant by referring to the earlier endorsement it\\nhad sent on 18.10.2010, by which cover for cancellation of the match due to\\nrain was deleted from the scope of the insurance policy.\\n\\n\\n Contentions\\n\\n\\n 4.     The appellant\\'s grievance is that the impugned order, is erroneous.\\nLearned senior counsel Mr. Amit Sibal appearing for the appellant contends,\\nthat the insurer is an instrumentality of the State under\\n \\n  Article 12\\n \\n of the\\nConstitution and has to act reasonably and bona fide. It is contended that\\ndeleting the rain cover from the insurance policy, after the insurer had paid\\nthe premium amount, was illegal and arbitrary. The insurer\\'s actions, says\\nMr. Sibal, were mala fide since after the Kochi ODI was cancelled due to\\nrain, and it had to pay the insurance amount to the appellant, it decided to\\nunilaterally revoke the rain cover from the insurance policy so as to escape\\nthe rain cover liability for the Goa event. It is contended that such arbitrary\\nand unilateral action on the part of the insurer violates\\n \\n  Article 14\\n \\n of the\\nConstitution and makes out a fit case for exercise of jurisdiction of this\\nCourt under\\n \\n  Article 226.\\n \\n\\n\\n 5.     The impugned judgment, as it holds that the dispute is primarily a\\nmoney claim and therefore not subject matter of\\n \\n  Article 226\\n \\n , is questioned.\\nIt is argued that the primary relief sought was the quashing of the arbitrary\\nand unilateral endorsement schedule dated17.10.2010 issued by the insurer\\nand the subsequent letters dated 27.10.2010 and 04.10.2011. The writ\\n \\n  LPA No.354/2016                                             Page 3 of 21\\n \\n petition was not instituted as a money claim per se but was merely a\\nconsequential relief to the primary prayer of the appellant for issuance of\\nwrit or a direction/order in the nature of writ quashing the Endorsement\\nSchedule dated 20.10.2010 and which did not involve any complex/disputed\\nquestions of fact or require evidence in trial.\\n\\n\\n 6.     The finding of the impugned judgment as to the absence of public law\\ncharacter of the dispute is questioned. It is contended that condoning the\\nactions of the insurer would create a wrong precedent and discourage\\ncompanies like the appellant from providing services essential for generating\\nrevenues from international public sport matches such as cricket, which in\\nturn would hamper the growth of sports. Especially, in the context of a game\\nlike cricket, allowing such actions by the insurer affects the larger public\\ninterest. Reliance was placed on behalf of the appellant on the Division\\nBench decision of this Court in\\n \\n  Rahul Mehra v. Union of India\\n \\n , (2004) 114\\nDLT 323:\\n\\n\\n \"To say that cricket is a great game would be a value judgment\\n       for there may be people who regard it as an abomination. But,\\n       to say that cricket is a craze in India, would not be far from the\\n       truth. Indeed, it is a passion, an obsession. A victory by the\\n       Indian team sends a thrill of exhilaration amongst the masses.\\n       Equally, a defeat brings despair and gloom. And, in extreme\\n       cases, anger, violence and riots. Every nuance of the game is\\n       debated, every umpiring decision is dissected and every ball\\n       bowled and run taken is watched by millions with rapt attention.\\n       To say that the Indian public is vitally interested in the game\\n       and the fate of its team would be an understatement.\"\\n\\n\\n 7.     The appellant placed reliance on the decision in\\n \\n  ABL International v.\\nExport Credit Guarantee Corporation of India\\n \\n , (2004) 3 SCC 553 to\\ncontend that writ jurisdiction under\\n \\n  Article 226\\n \\n can be exercised even in\\n \\n  LPA No.354/2016                                              Page 4 of 21\\n \\n contractual matters. Reliance is also placed on\\n \\n  Joshi Technologies\\nInternational Inc. v. Union of India\\n \\n , (2015) 7 SCC 728, specifically on the\\nfollowing part of the decision-\\n\\n\\n \"[....] No doubt, there is no absolute bar to the maintainability\\n       of the writ petition even in contractual matters or where there\\n       are disputed questions of fact or even when monetary claim is\\n       raised.\"\\n\\n\\n The appellant contends that in the present case, there are no disputed\\nquestions of fact and the insurance policy has been placed on record.\\nMoreover, in cases of a concluded contract such as the present one, it would\\nnot be open to the insurer to plead mistake as a ground to preclude exercise\\nof writ jurisdiction. It is also argued that in the insurance sector, the\\ngovernment has not entirely opened the playing field to private players and\\nin such a situation, there is a higher duty of fairness and a higher burden of\\nacting reasonably, that is placed on the public authority. In the present case,\\non the strength of the insurance cover, the appellant entered into a number of\\ncontracts with other agencies and companies in relation to the event\\nmanagement of the cricket match that was to be held in Goa and incurred\\nsignificant expenditure in respect of the same. Finally, it is urged that\\nrelegation of the appellant to civil courts would cause serious prejudice on\\naccount of delay and that in any case, the availability of an alternative\\nremedy would not preclude writ jurisdiction when it is evident that the acts\\nof the public agency were arbitrary, unreasonable and mala fide.\\n\\n\\n 8.     The respondent urges that this appeal is not maintainable as the matter\\nessentially is a contractual dispute. The insurers deny that there was any\\nmala fides on their part in the deletion of the clause from the insurance\\n \\n  LPA No.354/2016                                             Page 5 of 21\\n \\n policy. It is urged that at the request of the appellant with the concerned\\nbranch office of the insurer company for obtaining Standard Fire and Special\\nPerils Policy covering the Kochi and Goa ODI matches, the said branch\\noffice forwarded the proposal to the regional office of the company. On\\nexamination of the proposal, the competent authority at the regional office\\ninformed the branch office that cover is to be given as per Standard Fire and\\nSpecial Perils Policy, but the said branch misconstrued the cover and they\\nalso allowed rain cover along with perils as per the policy. The insurer\\nrealized the mistake when it received an intimation of claim from the\\nappellant after the cancellation of the Kochi ODI match due to rain. While\\nthe insurer settled the claim of the appellant for that match, having realized\\nits mistake it immediately notified the appellant of the same and by an\\nendorsement notice dated 18.10.2010, clarified that the inclusion of rain\\ncover was done mistakenly and the same was accordingly withdrawn. It is\\ncontended that the same was done much before the Goa ODI match, which\\nwas scheduled on 24.10.2010.\\n\\n\\n 9.     The learned counsel contends therefore that the single judge\\'s order\\ndoes not call for any interference. It is contended that the claim of the\\nappellant is essentially a contractual one and is a money claim that has been\\ndressed up as a writ petition merely because the insurance provider is an\\ninstrumentality of the State. It is further submitted that withdrawal of a\\nparticular coverage from the policy, much prior to the commencement of the\\nrisk does not amount to an act that is in violation of the tenors of\\n \\n  Article 14\\n \\n of the Constitution. Since the relief claimed by the appellant is essentially\\none of damages for breach of contract, it is argued that the appellant must be\\nrelegated to pursue civil proceedings in respect of the same. If the court\\n \\n  LPA No.354/2016                                             Page 6 of 21\\n \\n were to entertain writ proceedings in such matters, it would open the\\nfloodgates to frivolous litigations whereby parties in order to avoid trial and\\ncircumvent the delays inherent in normal civil proceedings, would invoke\\nthe extraordinary writ jurisdiction of this court and claim what are\\nessentially contractual remedies.\\n\\n\\n Decision and Reasoning\\n\\n\\n 10.    The law relating to the exercise of writ jurisdiction in case of\\ncontractual matters, where one of the contracting parties is an\\ninstrumentality of the State within the meaning of\\n \\n  Article 12\\n \\n of the\\nConstitution, has received extensive judicial scrutiny. Before proceeding to\\nthe merits of this case, it would therefore be appropriate and necessary to\\nrecount some of the principles that have emerged from various decisions of\\nthe Supreme Court on this aspect.\\n \\n  In Life Insurance Corporation of India v.\\nEscorts Limited\\n \\n , AIR 1986 SC 1370, the Supreme Court held:\\n\\n\\n \"Broadly speaking, the Court will examine actions of State if\\n       they pertain to the public law domain and refrain from\\n       examining them if they pertain to the private law field. The\\n       difficulty will lie in demarcating the frontier between the public\\n       law domain and the private law field. It is impossible to draw\\n       the line with precision and we do not want to attempt it. The\\n       question must be decided in each case with reference to the\\n       particular action, the activity in which the State or the\\n       instrumentality of the State is engaged when performing the\\n       action, the public law or private law character of the action\\n       and a host of other relevant circumstances.\"\\n\\n\\n Similarly, in\\n \\n  Bareilly Development Authority v. Ajay Pal Singh\\n \\n ,\\n(1989) 1 SCR 743, the Court noted:\\n\\n\\n LPA No.354/2016                                              Page 7 of 21\\n\\n\\n \"20. This finding, in our view, is not correct in the light of the\\n       facts and circumstances of this case because in Ramana\\n       Dayaram Shetty\\'s case there was no concluded contract as in\\n       this case. Even conceding that the BDA has the trappings of a\\n       State or would be comprehended in \\'other authority\\' for the\\n       purpose of\\n \\n  Article 12\\n \\n of the Constitution, while determining\\n       price of the houses/flats constructed by it and the rate of\\n       monthly installments to be paid, the \\'authority\\' or its agent after\\n       entering into the field of ordinary contract acts purely in its\\n       executive capacity. Thereafter the relations are no longer\\n       governed by the constitutional provisions but by the legally\\n       valid contract which determines the rights and obligations of\\n       the parties inter-se. In this sphere, they can only claim rights\\n       conferred upon them by the contract in the absence of any\\n       statutory obligations on the part of the authority (i.e. BDA in\\n       this case) in the said contractual field.\\n\\n\\n 21. There is a line of decisions where the contract entered into\\n       between the State and the persons aggrieved is non-statutory\\n       and purely contractual and the rights are governed only by the\\n       terms of the contract, no writ or order can be issued under\\n \\n  Article 226\\n \\n of the Constitution of India so as to compel the\\n       authorities to remedy a breach of contract pure and simple :\\n \\n  Radhakrishna Agarwal v. State of Bihar\\n \\n (1977) 3 SCR 249;\\n \\n  Premji Bhai Parmar v. Delhi Development Authority\\n \\n (1980) 2\\n       SCR 704 and D. F. O. v. Biswanath Tea Company Ltd. (1981) 3\\n       SCR 662.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n  In National Highways Authority of India v. Ganga Enterprises\\n \\n , (2003)\\n7 SCC 410, it was held:\\n\\n\\n \"It is settled law that disputes relating to contracts cannot be\\n       agitated under\\n \\n  Article 226\\n \\n of the Constitution of India. It has\\n       been so held in the cases of Kerala SEB v. Kurien E. Kalathil\\n       (2000) 6 SCC 293,\\n \\n  State of U.P. v. Bridge and Roof Company\\n       (India) Ltd\\n \\n . (1996) 6 SCC 22 and\\n \\n  Bareilly Development\\n       Authority v. Ajai Pal Singh\\n \\n (1989) 2 SCC 116. This is settled\\n       law. The dispute in this case was regarding the terms of offer.\\n\\n\\n LPA No.354/2016                                              Page 8 of 21\\n\\n\\n They were thus contractual disputes in respect of which a writ\\n       court was not the proper forum. Mr. Dave, however, relied\\n       upon the cases of\\n \\n  Verigamto Naveen v. Govt. of A.P\\n \\n .(2001) 8\\n       SCC 344 and\\n \\n  Harminder Singh Arora v. Union of India\\n \\n (1986)\\n       3 SCC 247. These, however, are cases where the writ court was\\n       enforcing a statutory right or duty. These cases do not lay down\\n       that a writ court can interfere in a matter of contract only. Thus\\n       on the ground of maintainability the petition should have been\\n       dismissed.\"\\n\\n\\n 11.    These decisions evidence the initial trend of the Courts to not exercise\\ntheir power of judicial review in writ jurisdiction to examine what are\\nessentially contractual disputes. The scope of writ jurisdiction in contractual\\nmatters was somewhat expanded - and on behalf of the appellant significant\\nemphasis was placed on this decision - in the case of ABL International\\n(supra). In this case, the Court held:\\n\\n\\n \"19. Therefore, it is clear from the above enunciation of law\\n       that merely because one of the parties to the litigation raises a\\n       dispute in regard to the facts of the case, the court entertaining\\n       such petition under\\n \\n  Article 226\\n \\n of the Constitution is not always\\n       bound to relegate the parties to a suit. In the above case of Smt.\\n       Gunwant Kaur (supra), this Court even went to the extent of\\n       holding that in a writ petition, if facts required, even oral\\n       evidence can be taken. This clearly shows that in an\\n       appropriate case, the writ court has the jurisdiction to entertain\\n       a writ petition involving disputed questions of fact and there is\\n       no absolute bar for entertaining a writ petition even if the same\\n       arises out of a contractual obligation and or involves some\\n       disputed questions of fact.\\n\\n\\n 29. From the above discussion of ours, following legal\\n       principles emerge as to the maintainability of a writ petition:-\\n\\n\\n LPA No.354/2016                                              Page 9 of 21\\n\\n\\n (a) In an appropriate case, a writ petition as against a\\n              State or an instrumentality of a State arising out of a\\n              contractual obligation is maintainable.\\n\\n\\n (b) Merely because some disputed questions of facts arise\\n              for consideration, same cannot be a ground to refuse to\\n              entertain a writ petition in all cases as a matter of rule.\\n\\n\\n (c) A writ petition involving a consequential relief of\\n              monetary claim is also maintainable.\"\\n\\n\\n 12.    The decision in ABL (supra) however was later considered by the\\nSupreme Court in\\n \\n  Noble Resources Ltd. v. State of Orissa\\n \\n , (2006) 10 SCC\\n236 and it was held:\\n\\n\\n \"Although the scope of judicial review or the development of\\n       law in this field has been noticed hereinbefore particularly in\\n       the light of the decision of this Court in ABL International Ltd.\\n       (supra), each case, however, must be decided on its own facts.\\n       Public interest as noticed hereinbefore, may be one of the\\n       factors to exercise power of judicial review. In a case where a\\n       public law element is involved, judicial review may be\\n       permissible.\"\\n\\n\\n The law on this question was again comprehensively reviewed by the\\nSupreme Court in\\n \\n  State of Kerala v. M.K. Jose\\n \\n , (2015) 9 SCC 433. After\\nciting a catena of previous decisions of the Apex Court, the Court held:\\n\\n\\n \"We have referred to the aforesaid authorities to highlight\\n       under what circumstances in respect of contractual claim or\\n       challenge to violation of contract can be entertained by a writ\\n       court. It depends upon facts of each case. The issue that had\\n       arisen in ABL International (supra) was that an instrumentality\\n       of a State was placing a different construction on the clauses of\\n       the contract of insurance and the insured was interpreting the\\n       contract differently. The Court thought it apt merely because\\n       something is disputed by the insurer, it should not enter into the\\n \\n  LPA No.354/2016                                              Page 10 of 21\\n \\n realm of disputed questions of fact. In fact, there was no\\n       disputed question of fact, but it required interpretation of the\\n       terms of the contract of insurance. Similarly, if the materials\\n       that come on record from which it is clearly evincible, the writ\\n       court may exercise the power of judicial review but, a pregnant\\n       one, in the case at hand, the High Court has appointed a\\n       Commission to collect the evidence, accepted the same without\\n       calling for objections from the Respondent and quashed the\\n       order of termination of contract. The procedure adopted by the\\n       High Court, if we permit ourselves to say so, is quite unknown\\n       to exercise of powers under\\n \\n  Article 226\\n \\n in a contractual matter.\\n       We can well appreciate a Committee being appointed in a\\n       Public Interest Litigation to assist the Court or to find out\\n       certain facts. Such an exercise is meant for public good and in\\n       public interest. For example, when an issue arises whether in a\\n       particular State there are toilets for school children and there\\n       is an assertion by the State that there are good toilets, definitely\\n       the Court can appoint a Committee to verify the same. It is\\n       because the lis is not adversarial in nature. The same principle\\n       cannot be taken recourse to in respect of a contractual\\n       controversy. It is also surprising that the High Court has been\\n       entertaining series of writ petitions at the instance of the\\n       Respondent, which is nothing but abuse of the process of\\n       extraordinary jurisdiction of the High Court. The Appellate\\n       Bench should have applied more restraint and proceeded in\\n       accordance with law instead of making a roving enquiry. Such\\n       a step is impermissible and by no stretch of imagination\\n       subserves any public interest.\"\\n\\n\\n 13.    Therefore, it is clear that subsequent decisions have restricted the\\nholding in ABL International (supra) to the peculiar facts in that case and\\nhave reiterated the limited nature of writ jurisdiction- specifically, how it\\nshould not be exercised in contractual matters even if an instrumentality of\\nthe State is involved. For instance, in Rajasthan State Industrial\\nDevelopment and Investment Corporation v. Diamond and Gem\\n \\n  LPA No.354/2016                                               Page 11 of 21\\n \\n Development Corporation, (2013) 5 SCC 470, the Court after reviewing a\\nnumber of its previous decisions starting from Bareilly Development\\nAuthority (supra) held:\\n\\n\\n \"14. It is evident from the above, that generally the court should\\n       not exercise its writ jurisdiction to enforce the contractual\\n       obligation. The primary purpose of a writ of mandamus, is to\\n       protect and establish rights and to impose a corresponding\\n       imperative duty existing in law. It is designed to promote justice\\n       (ex debito justiceiae). The grant or refusal of the writ is at the\\n       discretion of the court. The writ cannot be granted unless it is\\n       established that there is an existing legal right of the applicant,\\n       or an existing duty of the Respondent. Thus, the writ does not\\n       lie to create or to establish a legal right, but to enforce one that\\n       is already established. While dealing with a writ petition, the\\n       court must exercise discretion, taking into consideration a wide\\n       variety of circumstances, inter-alia, the facts of the case, the\\n       exigency that warrants such exercise of discretion, the\\n       consequences of grant or refusal of the writ, and the nature and\\n       extent of injury that is likely to ensue by such grant or refusal.\\n\\n\\n 15. Hence, discretion must be exercised by the court on grounds\\n       of public policy, public interest and public good. The writ is\\n       equitable in nature and thus, its issuance is governed by\\n       equitable principles. Refusal of relief must be for reasons which\\n       would lead to injustice. The prime consideration for the\\n       issuance of the said writ is, whether or not substantial justice\\n       will be promoted. Furthermore, while granting such a writ, the\\n       court must make every effort to ensure from the averments of\\n       the writ petition, whether there exist proper pleadings. In order\\n       to maintain the writ of mandamus, the first and foremost\\n       requirement is that the petition must not be frivolous, and must\\n       be filed in good faith. Additionally, the applicant must make a\\n       demand which is clear, plain and unambiguous. It must be\\n       made to an officer having the requisite authority to perform the\\n       act demanded. Furthermore, the authority against whom\\n       mandamus is issued, should have rejected the demand earlier.\\n       Therefore, a demand and its subsequent refusal, either by\\n \\n  LPA No.354/2016                                               Page 12 of 21\\n \\n words, or by conduct, are necessary to satisfy the court that the\\n       opposite party is determined to ignore the demand of the\\n       applicant with respect to the enforcement of his legal right.\\n       However, a demand may not be necessary when the same is\\n       manifest from the facts of the case, that is, when it is an empty\\n       formality, or when it is obvious that the opposite party would\\n       not consider the demand.\"\\n\\n\\n In a recent decision in Joshi Technologies (supra), the Supreme Court\\nlaid down the following principles in relation to exercise of writ jurisdiction\\nin contractual matters:\\n\\n\\n \"Further legal position which emerges from various judgments\\n       of this Court dealing with different situations/aspects relating\\n       to the contracts entered into by the State/public Authority with\\n       private parties, can be summarized as under:\\n\\n\\n (i) At the stage of entering into a contract, the State acts\\n              purely in its executive capacity and is bound by the\\n              obligations of fairness.\\n\\n\\n (ii) State in its executive capacity, even in the contractual\\n              field, is under obligation to act fairly and cannot practice\\n              some discrimination.\\n\\n\\n (iii) Even in cases where question is of choice or\\n              consideration of competing claims before entering into\\n              the field of contract, facts have to be investigated and\\n              found before the question of a violation of\\n \\n  Article 14\\n \\n could arise. If those facts are disputed and require\\n              assessment of evidence the correctness of which can only\\n              be tested satisfactorily by taking detailed evidence,\\n              involving examination and cross-examination of\\n              witnesses, the case could not be conveniently or\\n              satisfactorily decided in proceedings under\\n \\n  Article 226\\n \\n of\\n              the Constitution. In such cases court can direct the\\n              aggrieved party to resort to alternate remedy of civil suit\\n              etc.\\n\\n\\n LPA No.354/2016                                               Page 13 of 21\\n\\n\\n (iv) Writ jurisdiction of High Court under\\n \\n  Article 226\\n \\n was not intended to facilitate avoidance of obligation\\n              voluntarily incurred.\\n\\n\\n (v) Writ petition was not maintainable to avoid\\n              contractual obligation. Occurrence of commercial\\n              difficulty, inconvenience or hardship in performance of\\n              the conditions agreed to in the contract can provide no\\n              justification in not complying with the terms of contract\\n              which the parties had accepted with open eyes. It cannot\\n              ever be that a licensee can work out the license if he finds\\n              it profitable to do so: and he can challenge the\\n              conditions under which he agreed to take the license, if\\n              he finds it commercially inexpedient to conduct his\\n              business.\\n\\n\\n (vi) Ordinarily, where a breach of contract is complained\\n              of, the party complaining of such breach may sue for\\n              specific performance of the contract, if contract is\\n              capable of being specifically performed. Otherwise, the\\n              party may sue for damages.\\n\\n\\n (vii) Writ can be issued where there is executive action\\n              unsupported by law or even in respect of a corporation\\n              there is denial of equality before law or equal protection\\n              of law or if can be shown that action of the public\\n              authorities was without giving any hearing and violation\\n              of principles of natural justice after holding that action\\n              could not have been taken without observing principles\\n              of natural justice.\\n\\n\\n (viii) If the contract between private party and the\\n              State/instrumentality and/or agency of State is under the\\n              realm of a private law and there is no element of public\\n              law, the normal course for the aggrieved party, is to\\n              invoke the remedies provided under ordinary civil law\\n              rather than approaching the High Court Under\\n \\n  Article\\n  \\n   LPA No.354/2016                                               Page 14 of 21\\n  \\n  226\\n \\n of the Constitutional of India and invoking its\\n              extraordinary jurisdiction.\\n\\n\\n (ix) The distinction between public law and private law\\n              element in the contract with State is getting blurred.\\n              However, it has not been totally obliterated and where\\n              the matter falls purely in private field of contract. This\\n              Court has maintained the position that writ petition is not\\n              maintainable. Dichotomy between public law and private\\n              law, rights and remedies would depend on the factual\\n              matrix of each case and the distinction between public\\n              law remedies and private law, field cannot be\\n              demarcated with precision. In fact, each case has to be\\n              examined, on its facts whether the contractual relations\\n              between the parties bear insignia of public element. Once\\n              on the facts of a particular case it is found that nature of\\n              the activity or controversy involves public law element,\\n              then the matter can be examined by the High Court in\\n              writ petitions Under\\n \\n  Article 226\\n \\n of the Constitution of\\n              India to see whether action of the State and/or\\n              instrumentality or agency of the State is fair, just and\\n              equitable or that relevant factors are taken into\\n              consideration and irrelevant factors have not gone into\\n              the decision making process or that the decision is not\\n              arbitrary.\\n\\n\\n (x) Mere reasonable or legitimate expectation of a\\n              citizen, in such a situation, may not by itself be a distinct\\n              enforceable right, but failure to consider and give due\\n              weight to it may render the decision arbitrary, and this is\\n              how the requirements of due consideration of a\\n              legitimate expectation forms part of the principle of non-\\n              arbitrariness.\\n\\n\\n (xi) The scope of judicial review in respect of disputes\\n              falling within the domain of contractual obligations may\\n              be more limited and in doubtful cases the parties may be\\n              relegated to adjudication of their rights by resort to\\n \\n  LPA No.354/2016                                               Page 15 of 21\\n \\n remedies provided for adjudication of purely contractual\\n              disputes.\"\\n\\n\\n It is clear from these decisions of the Supreme Court is that the Court\\nshould rarely, if ever, exercise its writ jurisdiction in contractual matters,\\neven though it may involve an instrumentality of the State. Contractual\\ndisputes, especially where they involve complicated questions of fact, are\\nbest left to civil courts to adjudicate in their jurisdiction.\\n\\n\\n 14.    In the present case, the appellant contends that the insurer\\'s actions in\\ndeleting a particular clause from the insurance policy were arbitrary and\\nunreasonable within the meaning of\\n \\n  Article 14\\n \\n of the Constitution. In reply\\nto this, the insurer contends that there was an inadvertent error on the part of\\nthe concerned branch office of the insurer and they mistakenly allowed rain\\ncover along with perils as per Standard Fire and Special Perils Policy. On\\ndiscovering this mistake however, the insurer contends that it immediately\\ncorrected the same and thereafter notified the petitioner about this change.\\nMoreover, the insurer contends that the petitioner did not object to this at the\\ntime but subsequently, once the match at Goa was cancelled because of\\nheavy rain, brought this claim regarding arbitrary and mala fide deletion of\\nthe particular clause in the insurance policy. The appellant, however\\ncontends that it immediately protested regarding the deletion of the clause.\\nWhat is clear therefore, is that this is a purely contractual dispute; an\\ninsurance policy is ultimately a private contract between two parties.\\nMoreover, there are disputed facts in the present case, i.e. the parties differ\\non certain crucial questions of fact as well. In such a situation, it would not\\nbe appropriate for the Court to exercise its writ jurisdiction to decide\\n \\n  LPA No.354/2016                                                  Page 16 of 21\\n \\n questions of fact and provide remedies to the appellant that are essentially\\ncontractual in nature.\\n\\n\\n 15.    The learned Single Judge in his order noted that the insurer had\\npleaded mistake and in line with the decision of the Supreme Court in\\n \\n  LIC of\\nIndia v. Asha Goel\\n \\n , (2001) 2 SCC 160, where the Court had refused to\\nentertain writ proceedings on grounds that the insurer had pleaded fraud,\\njurisdiction under\\n \\n  Article 226\\n \\n had to be rejected. The relevant portion of the\\nsingle judge\\'s order reads:\\n\\n\\n \"The petitioner herein has not placed the insurance policy on\\n       record. It is thus not known whether the same provides for\\n       arbitration. There is also a material factual dispute whether the\\n       petitioner protested against the Endorsement dated 17th\\n       October, 2010 prior to the cancellation of the match scheduled\\n       on 24th October, 2010; while the petitioner claims to have done\\n       so the respondent strongly refutes. We also do not know what\\n       were the other terms and conditions of the policy and whether\\n       the same permitted deletion of a peril prior to occurrence of\\n       loss attributable thereto. The effect if any of the instructions\\n       alleged to have been issued by the Competent Authority of the\\n       respondent at the Regional Office and in contravention whereto\\n       the policy is stated to have been issued can also not be\\n       considered and adjudicated without examination and cross\\n       examination of witnesses and which is not the domain of writ\\n       jurisdiction. Not only so, the assessment of monetary claim if\\n       any to which the petitioner may be entitled to also requires trial\\n       and neither does the claim has any public law character nor is\\n       any exceptional case for entertaining contractual claim in writ\\n       jurisdiction made out. Supreme Court, in\\n \\n  LIC of India vs. Asha\\n       Goel\\n \\n (2001) 2 SCC 160 also held that where plea of fraud is\\n       pleaded by Insurer, writ should not be entertained; here the\\n       respondent has pleaded mistake.\"\\n\\n\\n The Single Judge therefore relied on the decision in Asha Goel\\n(supra), to dismiss the writ petition as questions of fact were involved and\\n \\n  LPA No.354/2016                                              Page 17 of 21\\n \\n the claim was not of a public law character. The relevant portion of the\\ndecision in Asha Goel is extracted below:\\n\\n\\n \"10.\\n \\n  Article 226\\n \\n of the Constitution confers extraordinary\\n       jurisdiction on the High Court to issue high prerogative writs\\n       for enforcement of the Fundamental Rights or for any other\\n       purpose. It is wide and expansive. The Constitution does not\\n       place any fetter on exercise of the extraordinary jurisdiction. It\\n       is left to the discretion of the High Court. Therefore, it cannot\\n       be laid down as a general proposition of law that in no case the\\n       High Court can entertain a writ petition under\\n \\n  Article 226\\n \\n of\\n       the Constitution to enforce a claim under a life insurance\\n       policy. It is neither possible nor proper to enumerate\\n       exhaustively the circumstances in which such a claim can or\\n       cannot be enforced by filing a writ petition. The determination\\n       of the question depends on consideration of several factors,\\n       like, whether a writ petitioner is merely attempting to enforce\\n       his/her contractual rights or the case raises important\\n       questions of law and constitutional issues; the nature of the\\n       dispute raised; the nature of inquiry necessary for\\n       determination of the dispute etc. The matter is to be considered\\n       in the facts and circumstances of each case. While the\\n       jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain a writ petition under\\n \\n  Article 226\\n \\n of the Constitution cannot be denied altogether,\\n       Courts must bear in mind the self-imposed restriction\\n       consistently followed by High Courts all these years after the\\n       constitutional power came into existence in not entertaining\\n       writ petitions filed for enforcement of purely contractual rights\\n       and obligations which involve disputed questions of facts. The\\n       Courts have consistently taken the view that in a case where for\\n       determination of the dispute raised, it is necessary to inquire\\n       into facts for determination of which it may become necessary\\n       to record oral evidence a proceeding under\\n \\n  Article 226\\n \\n of the\\n       Constitution is not the appropriate forum. The position is also\\n       well settled that if the contract entered between the parties\\n       provides an alternate forum for resolution of disputes arising\\n       from the contract, then the parties should approach the forum\\n       agreed by them and the High Court in writ jurisdiction should\\n \\n  LPA No.354/2016                                              Page 18 of 21\\n \\n not permit them to bypass the agreed forum of dispute\\n       resolution. At the cost of repetition it may be stated that in the\\n       above discussions we have only indicated some of the\\n       circumstances in which the High Courts have declined to\\n       entertain petitions filed under\\n \\n  Article 226\\n \\n of the Constitution\\n       for enforcement of contractual rights and obligation; the\\n       discussions are not intended to be exhaustive. This Court from\\n       time to time disapproved of a High Court entertaining a\\n       petition under\\n \\n  Article 226\\n \\n of the Constitution in matters of\\n       enforcement of contractual rights and obligation particularly\\n       where the claim by one party is contested by the other and\\n       adjudication of the dispute requires inquiry into facts. We may\\n       notice a few such cases;\\n \\n  Mohammed Hanif v. The State of\\n       Assam\\n \\n (1970) 2 SCR 197;\\n \\n  Banchhanidhi Rath v. The State of\\n       Orissa and Ors\\n \\n . AIR 1972 SC 843 ;\\n \\n  Smt. Rukmanibai Gupta v.\\n       Collector, Jabalpur and Ors\\n \\n . AIR 1981 SC 479;\\n \\n  Food\\n       Corporation of India and Ors. v. Jagannath Dutta and Ors\\n \\n .\\n       (1993) 2 SCR 497; and\\n \\n  State of H.P. v. Raja Mahendra Pal and\\n       Ors\\n \\n . (1999) 2 SCR 323.\\n\\n\\n 11. The position that emerges from the discussions in the\\n       decided cases is that ordinarily the High Court should not\\n       entertain a writ petition filed under\\n \\n  Article 226\\n \\n of the\\n       Constitution for mere enforcement of a claim under a contract\\n       of insurance. Where an insurer has repudiated the claim, in\\n       case such a writ petition is filed the High Court has to consider\\n       the facts and circumstances of the case, the nature of the\\n       dispute raised and the nature of the inquiry necessary to be\\n       made for determination of the questions raised and other\\n       relevant factors before taking a decision whether it should\\n       entertain the writ petition or reject it as not maintainable. It has\\n       also to be kept in mind that in case an insured or nominee of\\n       the deceased insured is refused relief merely on the ground that\\n       the claim relates to contractual rights and obligations and he/\\n       she is driven to a long drawn litigation in the civil court, it will\\n       cause serious prejudice to the claimant/other beneficiaries of\\n       the policy. The pros and cons of the matter in the context of the\\n       fact situation of the case should be carefully weighed and\\n \\n  LPA No.354/2016                                               Page 19 of 21\\n \\n appropriate decision should be taken. In a case where claim by\\n       an insured or a nominee is repudiated raising a serious dispute\\n       and the Court finds the dispute to be a bona fide one which\\n       requires oral and documentary evidence for its determination\\n       then the appropriate remedy is a civil suit and not a writ\\n       petition under\\n \\n  Article 226\\n \\n of the Constitution. Similarly, where\\n       a plea of fraud is pleaded by the insurer and on examination is\\n       found prima facie to have merit and oral and documentary\\n       evidence may become necessary for determination of the issue\\n       raised then a writ petition is not an appropriate remedy.\"\\n\\n\\n 16.    Therefore, when a contractual dispute does not have an overriding\\npublic law character or where public interest is not involved, or where\\ncomplicated questions of fact must be gone into- such as in that case where\\nthe insurer had pleaded fraud, the Court must not exercise its writ\\njurisdiction in deciding insurance claims and such cases must be relegated to\\nthe civil courts. The appellant has urged that the single judge fell into error\\nin relying on Asha Goel (supra) as it dealt with the allegations of fraud\\nwhereas in the present case, the insurer says there was an inadvertent\\nmistake on its part. There is no merit in the submission of the insurer.\\nNo doubt Asha Goel (supra) concerned the allegation of fraud; nonetheless,\\nthe principle that emerges from the decision is not restricted to allegations of\\nfraud only. In fact, the Court clearly noted that where questions of fact are\\nneeded to be gone into and there is a dispute between the parties as to the\\nessential facts, then writ jurisdiction would be inappropriate. In the present\\ncase, the insurer has pleaded mistake; the ruling in Asha Goel (supra) would\\napply. There is a dispute on facts as well; in the circumstances even though\\nthe appellant has produced the copy of the insurance policy document, that is\\ninsufficient for the Court in exercise of its writ jurisdiction to decide the\\n \\n  LPA No.354/2016                                              Page 20 of 21\\n \\n present dispute. To agitate such a claim, the appellant has to be left to pursue\\ncivil proceedings in the appropriate court of law.\\n\\n\\n 17.    In the circumstances, the appeal has to fail. It is therefore, dismissed,\\nwithout order as to costs. It is of course open to the appellant to bring a\\nclaim before the appropriate court in civil proceedings. This judgment does\\nnot in any manner affect the merits of those proceedings and all rights and\\ncontentions of the parties are reserved.\\n\\n\\n S.
