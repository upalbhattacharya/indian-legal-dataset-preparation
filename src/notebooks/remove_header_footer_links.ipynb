      "interest of justice to inquire into the offence which appears to have been\n",
      "committed. To quote:\n",
      "\n",
      "“9. Reading of the sub-section makes it clear that the hub of this provision\n",
      "is formation of an opinion by the court (before which proceedings were to be\n",
      "held) that it is expedient in the interest of justice that an inquiry should\n",
      "be made into an offence which appears to have been committed. In order to form\n",
      "such opinion the court is empowered to hold a preliminary inquiry. It is not\n",
      "peremptory that such preliminary inquiry should be held. Even without such\n",
      "preliminary inquiry the court can form such an opinion when it appears to the\n",
      "court that an offence has been committed in relation to a proceeding in that\n",
      "court. It is important to notice that even when the court forms such an\n",
      "opinion it is not mandatory that the court should make a complaint. This sub-\n",
      "section has conferred a power on the court to do so. It does not mean that the\n",
      "court should, as a matter of course, make a complaint. But once the court\n",
      "decides to do so, then the court should make a finding to the effect that on\n",
      "the fact situation it is expedient in the interest of justice that the offence\n",
      "should further be probed into. If the court finds it necessary to conduct a\n",
      "preliminary inquiry to reach such a finding it is always open to the court to\n",
      "do so, though absence of any such preliminary inquiry would not vitiate a\n",
      "finding reached by the court regarding its opinion. It should again be\n",
      "remembered that the preliminary inquiry contemplated in the sub-section is not\n",
      "for finding whether any particular person is guilty or not. Far from that, the\n",
      "purpose of preliminary inquiry, even if the court opts to conduct it, is only\n",
      "to decide whether it is expedient in the interest of justice to inquire into\n",
      "the offence which appears to have been committed.” In the impugned order, the\n",
      "High Court did form an opinion after the inquiry. To quote:\n",
      "\n",
      "“90. It was argued on behalf of the state by the learned standing counsel that\n",
      "the ballistic expert’s deposition, Ex. PW-95 was calculated to let the accused\n",
      "Manu Sharma off the hooks. It was submitted that the witness had stated that\n",
      "no definite opinion could be given whether the two empty cartridges were fired\n",
      "from the same weapon. However, on the basis of the same material, he took a\n",
      "somersault and gave a completely contrary opinion in the Court saying that\n",
      "they appear to have been fired from different weapons. It was submitted that\n",
      "by the time this witness stepped on to the box, the defence had formed its\n",
      "definite plan about a “two weapon theory”.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deposition of this witness was sought to support the “two weapon theory”.\n",
      "That this court and Supreme Court rejected the theory did not in any way\n",
      "undermine the fact that PW-95 gave false evidence.” Therefore, what is to be\n",
      "seen is whether the High Court is justified in forming the opinion on\n",
      "commission of the offence under Section 193 of IPC.\n",
      "\n",
      "The stand of the appellant in his report (Ex PW-95/2) dated 04.02.2000, and\n",
      "while deposing before the court at the trial, it is to be noted, was\n",
      "consistent. Query No.3 was whether both the empty cartridges were fired from\n",
      "the same firearm or otherwise. Since there was no recovery of the firearm, the\n",
      "same was not sent along with the cartridges for the examination by the expert.\n",
      "Therefore, the opinion tendered was that he was unable to give any definite\n",
      "opinion in answer to Query No.3, “unless the suspected firearm is available\n",
      "for examination.” It was at that juncture, there was a court question.\n",
      "According to the court, “for reply to query no.\n",
      "\n",
      "3, the presence of the firearm was not necessary. The question was whether the\n",
      "two empty cartridges have been fired from one instrument or from different\n",
      "instruments”. To that question, the appellant responded that “after\n",
      "comparison, I am of the opinion that these two cartridge cases C/1 and C/2\n",
      "appeared to have been fired from two different firearms”. It is not a clear,\n",
      "conclusive, specific and definite opinion. In further examination, the\n",
      "appellant has clearly stated that “I have already stated these two cartridge\n",
      "cases appear to have been fired from two different fire arms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Definite opinion would have been given once the weapon is given to me for\n",
      "examination”.\n",
      "\n",
      "We fail to understand how the stand taken by the appellant, as above, attracts\n",
      "the offence of perjury. As we have already observed above, the appellant has\n",
      "all through been consistent that as an expert, a definite opinion in the case\n",
      "could be given only if the suspected firearm is available for examination. It\n",
      "is nobody’s case that scientifically an expert can give a definite opinion by\n",
      "only examining the cartridges as to whether they have been fired from the same\n",
      "firearm. It was the trial court which insisted for an opinion without the\n",
      "presence of the firearm, and in that context only, the appellant gave the non-\n",
      "specific and indefinite opinion. An expert, in such a situation, could not\n",
      "probably have given a different opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, this Court, in the decision rendered on the appeal filed by the\n",
      "accused and reported in Sidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma v. State (NCT of\n",
      "Delhi)[3], has specifically dealt with the issue explaining, and in a way,\n",
      "justifying the stand of the appellant. To quote:\n",
      "\n",
      "“180. Similar is the case with the expert opinion of PW 95 which is again\n",
      "inconclusive. There is no evidence on record to suggest that PW 95 gave an\n",
      "opinion to oblige the prosecution. On the contrary, his response to the court\n",
      "question reveals that he was extremely confused as to the issue which had to\n",
      "be addressed by him in the capacity of an expert. In the concluding part of\n",
      "his testimony he reaffirms the opinion given by him which is that without test\n",
      "firing the empties from the weapon of offence no conclusive opinion can be\n",
      "given.” (Emphasis supplied) This Court in State (Delhi) v. Pali Ram[4] held\n",
      "that:\n",
      "\n",
      "“51. ….the real function of the expert is to put before the court all the\n",
      "materials, together with reasons which induce him to come to the conclusion,\n",
      "so that the court, although not an expert, may form its own judgment by its\n",
      "own observation of those materials. Ordinarily, it is not proper for the court\n",
      "to ask the expert to give his finding upon any of the issues, whether of law\n",
      "or fact, because, strictly speaking, such issues are for the court or jury to\n",
      "determine”.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Ramesh Chandra Aggrawala v. Regency Hospitals[5], this Court has dealt with\n",
      "the difference between an ‘expert’ and ‘a witness of fact’.\n",
      "\n",
      "“20. An expert is not a witness of fact and his evidence is really of an\n",
      "advisory character. The duty of an expert witness is to furnish the Judge with\n",
      "the necessary scientific criteria for testing the accuracy of the conclusions\n",
      "so as to enable the Judge to form his independent judgment by the application\n",
      "of these criteria to the facts proved by the evidence of the case. The\n",

      "change his views. It was stated that “if an expert's opinion is not properly\n",
      "researched because he considers that insufficient data is available, then this\n",
